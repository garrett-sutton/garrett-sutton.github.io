## About me
I'm a Catholic. I'm a husband to Grace and dad to Gwen.
I run a lot and love riding my bike when I have the 
time. I'm a diehard Steelers fan, also a Badger fan, and 
a sports fan in general. I currenly live in 
Madison, WI and work as a software developer at Epic 
(look up our campus if you haven't heard of it ;)).
