I read David and Goliath over the holiday season 
in 2023. Similar to other Gladwell books, this book
seeks to present evidence to support a larger point.
And the point in this book is to try to 
understand why underdogs ever make a story for 
themselves in the first place. I'd encourage
you to check it out if you want to hear compelling
stories that illustrate themes of how underdogs 
overcome.

You can find a review or summary of the book
anywhere online, so there isn't much purpose in me
also doing that. I hope to highlight several points
in the book that provoked me and why.

## Is the reach school the best for me?
Society typically pushes kids these days to go to
the best school they can get into. And the luster
around going to an elite school also appeals to the
student. However; David and Goliath makes the 
point that going to the "better" school (especially
in the case where it is the student's reach school)
isn't always better for every student. In fact, 
aside from the top 1% of students at elite schools,
most students end up achieving similar levels of
success in their academic careers (he uses papers
published for Ph.D. students) regardless of where
they go to school.

When I was coming out of high school, I was mostly
concerned with being able to run in college and
pursue an engineering degree in the process. 
As a general sports fan wanting to "prove" 
myself, I dreamt of running at a Division 1 school.
I had a few race results that allowed me to have
some conversations with some Division 1 coaches,
so I had hope. At the same time, I was a 
big fish in a little pond. My high school was in the
smaller school divisions of competition and I was 
one of the only guys on my team that took running
very seriously. For a while, I leaned into the fact
that I was having a few visits at Division 1 schools
and neglected the later fact. In the classroom, I had
some teachers that were saying things like "engineering
students are best off going to bigger schools." And in 
my friend group, close buddies were going off to Penn
State. I thought I could make that world happen.

Eventually, though, push came to
shove and I was only really presented with a scholarship
opportunity at Division 2 Gannon University. They also had a 
biomedical engineering program. But the admission rate
was 85%. This wasn't necessarily what I dreamed of, but 
it was going to be the most cost-effective option, so I 
went with it. 

Now 9 years later, I can confidently say I'm pretty happy
with my college experience. No, I didn't run Division 1 
track or cross country. No, I didn't graduate with a degree
that people around the country have heard of. But in 
reality, I didn't have the chops to run at the Division 1
level. Aside from about three-quarters of a season, I 
barely had the chops to run at the Division 2 level. 
I had a lot of fun being around the same level as most of
my teammates rather than having to try to prove to myself
every day that I wasn't the worst guy on the team.

I did well in school, finished with a high GPA, and got
a job at Epic - the company I'm still working at nearly 5 years later. 
I attribute at least some of my academic success to 
still feeling like a big fish in a little pond. Given the
smaller class sizes at Gannon, I got to know almost all of 
my classmates. And in getting to know them, I easily
had access to their minds in times of struggle - whether
it was just me, just them, or all of us struggling. I
think this access to peers was helpful for me to
overcome any imposter syndrome I faced during college.
The Gannon experience was far from perfect, but generally
speaking, it worked out for me (& I did meet Grace here too ;)).

Conversely, I've talked with those friends who went to Penn 
State (and did really really well while there), and I'm not 
sure how well I would have done in that environment. 
I could certainly see myself looking around a big lecture hall
in the middle of a difficult lecture and thinking, "Wow, 
all of these kids are so much smarter than me," while I neglected
to listen to another 5 minutes of the lecture. I know I would
have worked hard and made it through, but I tend to doubt
I would have done as well. And with that, I doubt I'd have 
ended up with as high of a GPA and likely wouldn't be at Epic
as a result. None of these proposed
realities may have led me into a "bad" place, but it
would be different from the happy place I am in today. 

I highlight these points about potentially attending Penn
State because I think I fall outside the norm
in my college selection experience. As is pointed out in
David and Goliath, we're often pushed to reach for the
the best school we can imagine. For me, going to the
fall-back school (as I perceived it at the time) may have
been the best thing for me.

## Doing hard things
David and Goliath highlights that there are some cases
where underdogs overcome because of how much of an 
underdog they are. These stories include people who 
grew up in lower-class neighborhoods and have learning
disabilities. Gladwell makes the point that - sometimes -
these folks achieve great things because all they have
ever known is struggle. Other people may give up when
faced with problems or have the resources to avoid 
certain problems. 

I found this section of the book interesting, 
largely because this is a recurring theme  
from my recent internet and YouTube browsing. Elsewhere, I've 
been hearing it called out that it is good for us
humans to do hard things. Throughout most of human history,
we have known constant conflict. Only recently, with 
the development of modern technologies, modern medicine, and a 
the dramatic increase in wealth, have we started to 
routinely experience a life that is notably easier than
previous generations. Even still, the world isn't always
rainbows and gumdrops. We aren't void of hard things. 
But if we don't have experience dealing with stressful
situations, we won't know how to handle stressful 
situations that we are presented with. It's not perfect,
but it feels fruitful to subject ourselves to voluntary
stress to give ourselves confidence that we can do 
actually hard things when they are presented to us. 

Reading about and watching people do hard things can
be inspiring, but I think it still takes a fair bit
of willpower and introspection to seek it out for
yourself. As someone who runs a fair amount, I can 
fall into the trap of thinking I do hard 
things because I get up at 5:30, run on most 
mornings and other people don't do that. Yes, 
getting up some mornings isn't easy. Yes, running isn't
necessarily an easy activity. But there comes a point
that getting up and running each morning is so
routine that it's not necessarily a hard thing
anymore. It feels important to be aware of this. At
that point, you've got to find additional hard 
things to take on. I think the answer is probably
obvious but may take some time to accept. The next 
hard thing is the thing you're dreading to do or
making excuses about doing. At
the time of writing this, that thing for me feels like
waking up a bit earlier, running more miles and 
introducing a workout (tempo, intervals, etc) into
the routine each week. And the biggest bugaboo is 
to sign up for a race!


## Being aware of doing hard things while raising kids
Gladwell tells an additional story about someone who 
grew up in lower class neighborhood and has worked to 
become one of the most successful people in Hollywood. 
The way that he grew up is drastically different from 
the way that his kids will grow up. The point is made
that this guy grew up in a reality where his parents
could tell him no because they couldn't afford it. 
But now, his wealth precludes him from using this same 
logic on his own kids. The former is probably much
simpler from the parent's standpoint. 

I've heard it said that all parents hope their 
kids have it better than they do. I think the previous 
story adds an interesting wrinkle to this goal of 
parents. Many self-made people have worked very hard,
overcame challenges and 
"made it." The end goal is largely a better life for
themselves and their family. But it is interesting that 
now, the struggle that may have contributed heavily
to their worldly success could be missing from their 
children's lives. As a very young parent at this point, 
I hope I keep this 
in mind in the future. Though yes, I want the very best
for my kids, Grace and I also have to keep in mind that
overcoming adversity is important for shaping kids.
