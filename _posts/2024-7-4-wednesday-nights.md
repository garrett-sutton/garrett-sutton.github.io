## what is this?
From fall 2022 through spring 2023, Grace and I
regularly attended an hour long talk on Wednesday
night with Father Enan at Saint Maria Goretti.
Each week of the month had a different flavor - 
an element of the Faith, a random Catholic topic from
a guest speaker and a week focusing on a sacrament
(Reconciliation in the fall and Holy Communion in the
spring). I'm creating this post in an effort to keep 
this information alive in my head and easily accessible.
So, below are the notes that had been hanging
out on my phone. I didn't modify any of the content from when
I originally wrote them over a year ago. Some of these notes 
might make no sense but when I come back to it some day, I 
hope it gives me a good enough starting point. I've made some 
tweaks to my original phone note formatting for easier 
reading here and made headings for each date so the lines
between topics are clear. 

## wednesday night notes
### 10/5/22
Morality
- God gives us Grace at our baptism. It is up to us to **WANT** 
to live up to that gift. We have to want to go to Heaven. It's 
not a points competition for our life on Earth.
- We might be made like God through His grace

### 10/12/22
- five solae of the reformation 
- sola scriptura
- 1 authority
- 2 sufficiency
- 3 clarity
- infallibility is a sticking point for protestants 


### 11/2/22
- Freedom - capacity to do what we ought
NOT do whatever we want
- indulging in this "do what we want" mentality (sin) is being enslaved 
- compare addiction to enslavement
- virtue - strength to build good conscience. Choose the good.
- vice - opposite of virtue. Create habits in sin.

### 12/7/22
#### Doctrine of Hell
- hell is real and it exists. 
- church doesn't definitely say that any someone is in hell
- need to know that this is up to God
- we can't guarantee everyone goes to Heaven but it is God's desire 

#### Virtues
- virtue: a part of you. Habitual and firm disposition to do the Good. 

##### Cardinal - 4 primary 
1.  prudence: governs the others. Right reason and then 
action. The driver of what we do. 
1.  justice: give to God and others as what is their due. 
Religion is justice towards God (relationship with Him). 
1.  temperance: regulation of our passionate desires. Sobriety, 
abstinence and chastity (restrain from drink, food, sex). Can 
have some but not so much you become a slave to it. Lent is a 
time we show this.
1.  fortitude: or courage. Engage or not engage in something that 
is difficult. Engage in something because it is overall good 
(go to job on a hard day because of needing a living and the 
job is a good thing ). 
Do not engage in something that shouldn't be addressed in a given 
situation. When is the time to fight and when is the time to not. 

#####  Theological
transform the Cardinal ones. Have to do with our relationship 
with God. Infused by God and our use of them is in 
cooperation with God's grace. 
1. faith: belief in God and in the things He has told us
1. hope: trust in God and adherences to the promises he 
has made. Waiting for promises to be fulfilled. Yearn for 
future Good.
1. Love/charity: will the good of the other person for 
their good. Must be learned by practice and trying to 
imitate Christ. Get to know people and trying to help 
them to do the thing that is 
right for them. Self interest is at odds with this.

- Faith and hope -> go away when you go to Heaven. Have seen 
and now no longer yearn

### 12/14/22
- Carigma - fundamental proclamation of the Gospel
- Pentacost Sunday - acts 2:36

#### part 1
God created everything out of nothing and everything is 
good. He made us in His image and likeness. Means we have a 
soul, intellect (to know), a heart, and free will. who am I? 
What is my purpose? 
What is my destiny. COG, love and serve God, Heaven
#### part 2
sin and death messed everything up. Genesis 3 - 
Adam and Eve. We live under the curse of sin and death. 
Foreshadowing in Genesis 3:15 of Mary
#### part 3
Christ event as rescue mission. God sends His son to 
save us. Does this in 3 ways: 
1. incarnation 
2. through his ministry & teaching
3. His Death & resurrection (firefighter analogy).  

#### part 4
our response to the above. Strive to serve him as he has 
served me. Moving from minimal to maximum. What can I do? 
instead of what do I have to do?


### 1/4/23
Review - semipalagianism (herecy that you earn your way into 
Heaven by following the commandments)

Divine Filiation- process of us becoming sons and daughters 
of God.

Christian, remember your dignity, and now that you share in 
God’s own nature, do not return by sin to your former base condition.

#### Commandments
1. Love your God alone. Love the Lord above all else. He has 
loved us and gives us the ability to love Him. God is always 
first. Him above all else - the right order of things. Am I 
numbing myself to the 
events of the day instead of knowing He is the source 
(going to them instead of Him first). Be free of said 
things and make sure the thing is 
not a crutch to you. 
2. Do not take the Lord your God in vain. Foul/profane 
language is different and less severe than using the Lord's 
name in vain. OMG. JC. Oh my Gosh / Goodness is different and ok.
3. Keep Holy the Sabbath Day. Mass is a part of it. In creation 
story, God rests and makes it Holy. Rest first cultivates 
Holiness. Practicing an idle period actually allows us to 
rest and lets the work 
that needs to be done in the world be let go. 
4. Honor your Mom and Dad. Also responsibility of parents 
to respect that their children honor them. Don't take 
advantage of them. Be honest with them. Children are not 
obligated to do things that 
are wrong (even if demanded by parents).

### 1/11/23
- Evangelical - bring about good news
- Laity - all those who aren't ordained or consecrated 
religious

- Common call of all the laity is to evangelize the world.

- Always be ready to provide your experience/story of faith. 
(This helps us to give our experience, instead of doctrinal 
arguing)

- Pray for open doors and for people by name.
- Expose yourself outside of the Church. Enjoy secular hobbies
- Be generally curious and amazed of people. Ask questions 
without immediate judgement. Every person is more interesting 
than the Grand Canyon.
- Share your experience of faith. And ask others for their 
experience.
- Fasting for someone (in addition to prayer)
- if good relationship with someone, help to build a 
faithful community around the person 
- life of intimacy with a Jesus is the predecessor to all 
of the above

### 1/18/23
- Dr. Brandt Petry book called Jesus and Jewish something
- Understand that as Catholics, we believe Eucharist is the 
real presence
- Transubstantiation - the substance of the thing changes - 
it changes during mass at consecration. Always and forever, 
as it continues to exist. Must keep later (tabernacle). It's 
Jesus who is the 
bread of life. Body, blood, soul and divinity
- Some protestants: consubstantiation - God is present during 
but not after. They believe it goes back to being bread.
- 7 sacraments are each a part of the redemptive work of Jesus.
- Receiving Eucharist is not required as part of our weekly 
obligation. 
- Receiving Eucharist ought to be viewed as the consummation 
of the mass. Similar to sex in marriage. How else could you 
be closer?
- incarnation - God among us
- to be in a state of sin and receiving is like trying to 
have sex during a time of conflict in marriage
- truly need to be forgiven before it's ok to move on
- maybe good to not take for granted sometimes.

The Mystery of the Church

- mystery: can know some but not perfectly all
- always another layer. Think of spouse 
- Ephesians 1:3-10 => 
- world created for the sake of the Church
- the Church allows us to come in union with God
- Church is a divine institution with a human component 
- Church's task is to evangelize and draw other people into 
the Church
- plan for the fullness of time - union of all of us with 
Christ. Church provides an avenue to fulfilling this plan.
- Redemption (Jesus death and resurrection). Restoration (our 
ongoing call to bring union to the Church). Car theft - 
returned (redemption). Fixing the mess of the returned 
car (restoring)
- think about our good must counteract the evil that exists 
within the world 


### 3/8/23
Sanctifying our work:

- as best as we can
- out of love and for the Good
- to give to God
- every person is called to be Holy
- offer our work as spiritual sacrifices
- mindset to offer our work to God. Our sacrifice (our alter) 
can be anywhere
- do these things out of Love for God and as best as we can
- bring our gifts spiritually and frequently 

Sanctifying ourselves in our work 

- everyone is called to be a Saint
- need to have one life (work + prayer) in union
- Christ even worked in his earthy life. 3 years of ministry 
and 30 years of working as a carpenter
- grow in virtue (brings us from being lazy to industrious). 
Try to be close to God during the especially monotonous times. 
Small prayers during the in between 

Sanctifying others through our work

 - the more we become like Christ, the more we love what 
 He loved - other souls.
 - offering parts of our day for others 
 - rectify our intentions to be praying for others 
 - cutting corners at work is like cutting corners for God
 - your prof is your hook is your own apostleate
 - example to others that shows I am working harder than 
 even my paycheck is worth
 - be good friends to the people you work with
 - listen to people and be interested in them 
 - Jesus came into the world to serve, NOT to be served 
 - looking for apostolic opportunities
 - try to find moral loving Christian solutions in our work
 - keep evangelization in mind

Surround ourselves with others to help us spiritually. Use 
others as gut checkers along the way. We need the help of others

Remaining Beatitudes (4-8)

- blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy
    - can only accomplish through Grace
    - we are called to constantly be merciful
    - forgive us our trustpasses as we forgive those who 
    trespass against us
    - relationship between being merciful and prudence. 
    It's ok to not be a doormat. Mercy is more about 
    forgiving. Not that we need to remain in those situatuons
- blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God
    - attitudes of the heart that are impure (e.g. gluttony, 
    lust, anger, etc). Especially when we indulge them
    - seek to be free of the above selfish and sinful dispositions 
- blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God
    - keeping peace is different from making peace. 
    - need to get through conflict sometimes to reach peace 
- blessed are those who are persecuted in the interest of seeking 
righteousness, for they shall 
    - ties into social Justice 

Social Justice 
- when hear SJ, what do you perceive that to mean?
- how would you describe it to your children?
- right to life
- right to the dignity of 


### 8/26/2023
Not a Wednesday night talk but leaving a note about 
St John Paul II's encyclical that he released on Aug 
6 (feast of the Transfiguration) called veritatis splendor 
that seeks to articulate Catholic moral principles. 
Important through the lens of modernity and how we as 
Catholics see the human person and what it means to be 
a Child of God and how that differs from the the modern 
view. Human existence is a gift and not something that 
we have to "become". If we are focusing so closely on what 
we "become" in this life we neglect the fact the God creating 
us is a gift. Rather we need to focus our efforts on becoming 
as close to him as possible. 

From Bishop Hying: https://madisoncatholicherald.org/veritatis-splendor-part-two/

Veritatis Splendor affirms that God loves us enough to 
take us seriously, especially in our moral actions, as 
He calls us to live in relationship with Him and to grow 
in His love and likeness
