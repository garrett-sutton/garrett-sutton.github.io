## The TLDR
We went to Loveland on the last day of our
4-day family/friend trip to Colorado in March 2023. 
I had previously been to Loveland in
March 2021 and left feeling like there was more
to be desired. A former local even described it
to me as a "niche" resort before our trip. This day, 
however, completely flipped the 
script for me. Loveland was a close second to my 
favorite day of the trip (behind an absolutely
dreamy day at Vail).  

### The would I go back?
Most definitely! Loveland isn't probably the place
I'd want to spend an entire trip, but it is a 
ton of fun for a day or 2. It has a lot of great 
intermediate-to-expert level terrain that doesn't seem 
to get bumped out nearly as much as a lot of other places 
I've been to. Most of the mountain isn't overly steep, 
allowing you to be creative and play through the 
various areas - high alpine bowls, groomers, or trees. 

I also value a  down-to-earth resort. Loveland 
has one of the cheapest lift tickets that I've 
seen in all of skiing but lacks the fancy amenities of 
other big resorts. You can tell skiing is the priority there! 

## The day
Even on a very windy - and consequently cold - day when 
the high elevation lifts were put on perpetual hold, we had a blast.
It was Sunday, so we went to church in Silverthorne before
skiing. This got us a late start, but it was
day 4 in a row of skiing. Almost everyone was talking about 
how they were only going to ski for a part of the day.

We started by taking a few runs and eventually getting to 
lift 8. This was awesome, albeit very windy at the top of
the lift. The wind was so bad that the chair would go flying
when you got off. It even hit my friend one time as he
was getting off the lift. Not fun for him.
The freezing wind was so worth it though. We lapped this lift
until lunchtime. While there, my brother-in-law found a huge 
jump that he kept trying to hit and do a 360 off of. I swear
the first time he did it, the wind carried him an extra 15 feet
that he never seemed to get on subsequent tries. As we kept going
off and skiing due east, it seemed like we were getting
freshies with every single run and it wasn't even snowing. I speculate that the wind was blowing so hard that it 
was just continuously depositing a ton of snow on east-facing 
slopes. The trees that get you back down to this lift were 
also a blast - open enough that you could feel comfortable moving
quickly and mellow enough that you weren't constantly worried 
about going too fast in tight quarters.

After lunch, the wind was even worse and the group's will to 
continue skiing was wavering. I think that by the end of the day,
only Chet's Dream, and Chair 2 were reliably open. Chair 6 seemed to
be going on temporary wind holds every so often. This isn't the end of the
world, but it's a risk you take that you might still be on the lift
when it stops for a little bit in the blowing and freezing wind. 
Not skiing stinks. Not skiing
and sitting on a cold lift in 50 mph wind gusts sucks. 

We took intermittent laps on 6, checking out terrain parks and the
other runs that area had to offer. It was nice that you could do a 
run off of 6, and navigate several patches of trees down the valley
to Chet's dream. Of note, I ate it hard during a run from Chair 6. Probably the best wipeout of the trip.
I went over a really steep (maybe inverted) roll that wasn't
marked and ended up on a near-flat landing. My ski tips went right into
the ground and I ejected. Luckily, no injuries or ever real pains to 
report back on. 

I think the majority of our skiing after lunch was off of Chet's Dream. 
And it felt like nearly every time we got to the top, we'd be 
saying "This might be my last one" and we ended up going until 
closing. This lift has that effect on you. It's a fast lift with
long and short runs to get back to it. We would go off skiers 
left, and combine a bunch of different trails with trees as you come
back down the valley to the base again. And we'd make a few runs straight
down the steep and bumpy areas right under the lift. 
I conned my dad into doing this with us just as he'd been
saying "This might be my last one." We ended up having to watch 
him make his way down for a little while - maybe a fall and popped
off ski along the way. 

There 
was good snow everywhere and no crowds anywhere. Simply put, 
a fantastic capper to a phenomenal trip.

### The snow
The snow at Loveland resembles all of the other Colorado 
ski resorts that I've been to. It is seemingly dry and cold
due to the high Colorado elevation. The wind is probably
always a factor here given Loveland's placement just east of the
Continental Divide. This provides constant potential  
for big leeward snow deposits.

Likely in part due to the wind, areas lower on the mountain
(most all of what we did on this trip) were well covered
and I recall bare or icy spots were rare. Loveland 
markets itself as the resort receiving the most snow
of any of the CO Front Range / Summit County resorts. In
both times I've been there, this seems like a fair claim.

### The mountain
On a map, Loveland looks like one really big bowl, made up
of several other small bowls and I70's Eisenhower tunnel 
in the middle. I feel that it can be split into the high 
alpine areas and below that. 

In the high alpine - especially
around lift 9, there's some steep wide-open bowl 
skiing. Areas serviced by the snowcat are all in the high
alpine and are all labeled as single black, double black, or
expert-level terrain. Other lifts like 4, 8, and Ptarmigan
also service high alpine areas but have easier ways down.

Below the high alpine, that is a variety of open groomers
and good tree skiing. The trees present a nice mix of close and 
steep with open and mellow. Much of this area is sort of
"create your own" while trying to get back to a lift.

I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the Chet's Dream lift specifically too.
This is the only high-speed quad lift and leaves right from the
base area. It goes to the South of the base area where you 
can hit some pretty gnarly terrain to skiiers right or traverse
to skiiers left and pick from a variety of blues, blacks, and
trees. The latter option is especially fun because those
can be some long runs and then you're rewarded with a
short lift ride back to the top.

## The human element
Loveland gives off a ragtag family vibe. It has terrain 
for everyone, with an affordable lift ticket and food. 
The latter two are almost unheard of 
at a ski resort circa 2023. 
There's no on-site lodging, so people are showing up 
with their eyes set on skiing. 

### The Crowds
We went to Loveland on a very windy Sunday. A lot of lifts 
were put on wind holds and eventually closed for the day. 
I imagine this isn't an all-too-uncommon occurrence since 
Loveland is situated on the Continental Divide. All of this 
is to say that by the end of the day, there were no crowds 
at all. We consistently skied down and right onto the lift. 
Even in the morning when some lifts were put on hold, it 
didn't seem like that many people ended up all congregated 
in a certain area. 

I think the forecasted high winds and the fact that said 
winds ended up coming to fruition certainly played a role 
in the limited amount of people we encountered. Additionally, 
Loveland not being classified as a destination resort like 
some of its neighbors - Breck, Keystone, Copper, etc - has 
to be considered as a consistent crowd limiter.

### The Amenities
Loveland doesn't have much for amenities compared to other 
ski resorts. At the base area, there is a ticket office, bar, 
cafeteria, and locker room.
It's reminds me of the place I grew up skiing - Blue Knob - 
in Central Pa.  The food was good and 
on par for the course - pretty cheap too. 
We did get to listen to some live music in the bar area while
we ate. 

There's not a whole lot else here, but I think if you're 
going to Loveland, that's part of the reason why. People 
come here to ski a really fun mountain at an affordable price.

One last thing. I was peeking at the Loveland website while
writing this post and came across what might be called an
amenity. I almost forgot because both times I've been at 
Loveland, the winds have been too bad to be up high on the
mountain. Loveland has a FREE snowcat that all you need to 
do to ride is ask for a sticker (or something like that) at
the ticket window in the morning. This takes you out
across the continental divide where you can drop in and 
let the fall line navigate you back to a lift.
