## Early vision
Early on in my time working at Epic, I started 
dreaming up where we would go for a sabbatical. 
After 5 years of tenure, employees at Epic can take a 
month-long sabbatical to visit any country in 
the world that you haven't been to before. 
You can also take it as 2 two-week trips
that are at least a year apart. Regardless of how you take
it, Epic will provide per diem pay during the 
trip and pay for some (or maybe even all) of your 
flight expenses. I started at Epic in July 2019, 
which made me due for a sabbatical in July 2024.

During COVID, I discovered professional cycling. 
For some reason, one day early on in the Tour de France,
I decided to turn the race on while I was working. From that
point forward, I was hooked. I watched every day for
the next 2+ weeks. It had to help that this
was Tadej Pogacar's first tour and concluded with his
mesmerizing TT to win. 

Separately, I run a lot. From starting
off with the Mountain Top Track and Field Club to 
running cross country in college, running has always been
a part of me. And I've thoroughly enjoyed a lot of running
literature over the years - from fiction books like 
Once a Runner, to training philosophies, to following
pros in their constant pursuit of the Olympics. Though
I more closely follow major American sports most
of the time, I love watching the Olympics on TV when the
time comes. It's a fantastic celebration of the world
and it's always fun to get to know and cheer for the 
many American athletes. 

And now the icing on the cake. The Tour de France typically
ends on the Champs Elysees in Paris in mid-to-late July and
the 2024 Summer Olympics (usually starting in late July or early
August) would be held in Paris. From here on out, France
was my dream destination given the perfect coincidence.

## Closer vision
A lot has happened since those days in the summer of 2020,
working in my dark apartment while watching the Tour 
de France. For one, the world is no longer in a pandemic, and 
I go to the office every day. I got married to my 
wonderful wife Grace. And we now have a beautiful baby
girl, Gwen.
And because of the Olympics, the Tour isn't going to finish in 
Paris for the first time since 1905. Instead, it will finish
in Nice with a Time Trial rather than the 8 ceremonious loops
of the Champs.

It's certainly a bright spot to not have a pandemic to worry
about for traveling. It's fantastic to have my favorite 
person locked in as a travel date. But she also works
and was off for nearly 4 months for Gwen's birth. And that's
not to mention Gwen. Taking what will be a 
nine-month-old on any travels, let alone internationally
presents a whole new set of challenges. And so does the 
Tour finishing in an unusual way that is many hours from
Paris.

So given our new set of circumstances, you might imagine
we had to amend our original trip aspirations. First, 
the 2-week flavor of the trip felt much more manageable.
Grace wouldn't have to be out of work for an entire month.
We wouldn't be overseas with a nine-month-old for an
entire month. I also feel like doing 2 weeks will be long 
enough to get away and enjoy the trip but also short enough
that if Gwen has a really tough time we wouldn't be miserable
for a whole month. It's all about balance.

And so there it was. The Tour de France ends in Nice on Sunday
July 21. The Olympics start in Paris on Friday, July 26. We 
could still fit in an abbreviated version of the original 
trip plan. And then we have the flexibility to take another 
trip a year after this one!

## High level plan
- Trip Start: 7/17
- Trip technically ends: 7/30
- I plan to go back to work: 8/5

### Travel to France
Plan to fly into Nice, France.
This will likely be an overnight 
red-eye that leaves Madison during 
the afternoon of the 17th and 
arrives in Nice around 11 am on the 18th.

### Tour de France
After arriving in France on the 18th, 
we'd want to try to see the last 3 stages of 
the Tour de France in and around the 
Nice area.

| Date|TdF Stage |Stage detail | End location time from Nice | End location time from previous end location |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Friday July 19 |      Stage 19 | North to South. 3 Mtn passes (1. Col de Vars 2. Cime de la Bonette 3. Isola 2000) |90 min| -- |
| Saturday July 20 |     Stage 20 | South to North. 4 Mtn passes (1. Col de Braus 2. Col de Turini 3. Col de la Colmiane 4. Col de la Couillole) Nice into Mtns  |90 min|60 min|
| Sunday July 21 |       Stage 21 | Monaco to Nice TT |--|90 min|

### The Alps
Go to a town in the Alps on Sunday after the 
Tour or spend the night in Nice and go to the
mountains first thing on Monday morning. We'd plan to stay
in the mountains until we make our way to Paris on 
July 26. 

Relevant dates to look for (by night):
- Sunday, July 21 (TBD)
- Monday, July 22
- Tuesday, July 23
- Wednesday, July 24
- Thursday, July 25

### The Olympics in Paris
As I was looking for Olympic tickets in September
and October 2023, there were none available.
All that I could find were these ultra-expensive 
hospitality packages that cost upwards of 5k per person
for a single event. I was starting to wonder if
the Olympics could even be affordable for normal people.
Then I lucked into looking over the Olympics website in late 
November 2023 to find new ticket sales would be
available on 11/30. We talked about what events we
were interested in (see [Olympic Ticket Priorities](#olympic-ticket-priorities)) and I woke
up at 2:30 AM CT to get online for the 10 AM Paris time
ticket drop. Once it was my turn at the ticket exchange,
I managed to get the following tickets.

|Date|Time|Sport|Event Code|
|-|-|-|-|
|7/27   | 4hr@9AM |M/W Rowing Heats     |ROW01 |
|7/28   | 3hr@3PM| M/W Prelim Beach Volleyball  |VBV05 |

Simply getting Olympics tickets helped to inform the other steps above.
There is still the possibility in the future that other 
tickets could become available on the resale market this spring.
The resale platform is not yet up and running, so we will 
wait to see what that might look like in the coming months. 

Given the event dates, I expect we'll need to have lodging 
in Paris for (at least):
- Friday, July 26
- Saturday, July 27
- Sunday, July 28

### Normandy
Based on several testimonials from friends, Paris might not
be the type of city that we want to spend a ton of additional
time in. Hopefully, we'll be able to hit most of what we want
to see as we make our way to a few Olympic events. 
I'm also not beholden to returning to work when the 2-week 
trip technically ends - I can take additional vacation 
time. This opens up the possibility of venturing out to 
Normandy to see a pivotal piece of American and world 
history. I would expect this to be a one-night excursion, so
we would need a place to stay on Monday, July 29 before 
heading back to Paris on July 30.

### Getting home
As mentioned above, my sabbatical technically ends on 
July 30, but I plan to take some additional vacation
time that doesn't require me to be back to work until
8/5. There is an open question to answer after this post
as to whether there are things that we might want to do (Olympics or otherwise) on:
- Tuesday, July 30
- Wednesday, July 31
- Thursday, August 1
- Friday, August 2

Some of our decision-making when returning home will be
informed by:
- The cost of return flights on a given day
- How hardy we think Gwen will be. 2+ weeks outside
of her element might be tough on her and quite frankly on
us too.
- Our desire to balance having some time to recover when
getting back vs wanting to see/do as much as possible
with the trip
