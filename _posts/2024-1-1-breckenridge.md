## The TLDR
We went to Breckenridge as part of a big family/friend
ski trip in March 2023. This was day 1 of 4 days of skiing on 
our trip. I think my tone around Breckenridge will be somewhat
critical.

### The would I go back?
I'm not sure that I would. Though there was some great skiing 
to be had, I found it to be a lot of the same - high alpine,
bowl skiing that was sort of difficult to navigate. And given
it's proximity to many other resorts, I could pass on Breck
the next time around. 

## The day
On our trip, we stayed in Frisco, so we caught the bus over to Breck
on a Thursday morning. After we got going, we generally tried to 
complete a north-to-south path for the day. We started by riding the 
BreckConnect gondola and did the Independence and Freedom chairs
for a few runs while we waited for the Kenosho chair to open. There was
some really fun and playful tree skiing off of one of these chairs. If
I recall correctly Kenosho, it was delayed due to wind. 
Kenosho gets you to peak 6 and it's way out there to the north end of
the resort. I can still vividly feel taking a turn to the north
off of Kenosho over into a wide-open bowl with a bunch of pow. 
It's a nearly indescribable feeling as you float on 2 pieces of 
wood. There were a few rocks that popped up along the descent 
that brought me back to reality though. There were several other
runs off of Kenosho that had a similar vibe -- steep open and covered
in largely untracked snow. 

During our time in the Peak 6 area, I also 
had the embarrassing blunder of stopping
emphatically next to someone on the hill that
I thought was my buddy and his girlfriend. Oops.
I'm pretty sure we coincidentally found him at
the bottom of that run though.

After a few runs in this area, I imagine it was getting to be closer 
to lunchtime and we still had a long way to go to keep hitting
new areas. To make the traverse faster, we hit up the infamous t-bar.
Dan was not so fortunate with the t-bar. He fell, and got yelled at by
the lifty, but cheered on by all of the howling onlookers to never
let go. He eventually had to let go. 

Off of the t-bar, we made our way to the area of Imperial and chair 6. 
Given the wind, Imperial was on and off wind hold all day, but we 
did manage to get a few runs on it. It was busy up in that area, and you
could tell the wind takes that snow. I remember some pow-like spots 
and soon after bare-ish rock spots. Below Imperial is chair 6, a classic
slow-moving lift with pretty much all-black runs to get down to it. This 
area was a lot of fun, but the lift line at the bottom paired with the
slow lift ride up made it a hard sell for a group that skis less than
5 times a year. 

After 6, we made it to E-chair and pretty much finished the day with laps
on Peak 9. Peak 9 had a lot of wide-open blue-ish runs, some terrain park
action, and a limited amount of trees. It was bluebird all day but felt 
especially so during this time. Crisp air, hard pack, and lots of rays to 
soak in. We also saw and heard military jets flying low around this point.
It's unclear if the Falcon chair was open at all on the day we were there, 
but needless to say, if it was, we just didn't have the time to make it 
that far (peak 10). 

We must have gotten on the Peak 8 superchair somehow from Peak 9 
to make the ultra-long run down through the village and to the parking lot.

Below, I put together a map that generally looks like the path for the day. 
It's not supposed to be an exact representation of our day. In addition to 
giving context to my account from above, I'm using it as a platform to complain a 
little bit.

The high terrain at Breck is super cool, but the lift situation is tough. 
The longest lifts on the mountain take you up over a lot of mellow terrain
to (I'm guestimating) 80% of the way to the top. There are then other much
shorter lifts that get you to the highest points. the problem with this is
twofold:
1. The expert-level runs are pretty short and if you want a long run, 
you'll have to take multiple lifts to get back to the very top. This 
makes the navigation between peaks pretty slow. Lesson to be learned - If 
you're looking to get to a certain spot, don't mess around in getting there.
1. The lift lines at these expert-level lifts are sort of long. This happens 
when everyone looking for the expert-level terrain ends up lapping these 
short (but steep) runs. 
1. Separately, the terrain below the treeline has (from what I discovered) a 
pretty limited amount of actual tree skiing. I ran into one set of trees 
around the lower part of peak 7 that was actually kind of sketchy. Once
you got into them, you were pretty much stuck with no way out. Many of 
the open runs at Breck are lined with trees and it looked like most all of
the trees were super close together and likely not a great idea to venture
into.

## The skiing

### The snow
There was a wide variety of snow at Breck - all pretty good too. There are a lot 
of groomers that are hard and fast. In the high alpine areas, there was 
untracked snow that was refilled pretty quickly due to the high winds. This can
also lead to a good amount of bare spots/risk of rocks in some areas. In the 
trees, the snow was also nice. Given we were there in March, the trees were holding a
good amount of snow and seemed to have limited bare spots.

### The mountain
I mentioned a lot of the details on how I felt about the areas that we skied above. My
take of each peak that we skied: 
#### Peak 6 
- Way up there and out of the way
- Nice open bowl skiing at the top
- Longish runout to get back to the lift

#### Peak 7
- A lot of nice and long blue runs
- Some trees to the north end
- Otherwise not a lot of variation from one blue 
to the next

#### Peak 8
- Home of Imperial
- T-Bar is an experience and difficult for someone who has never done it before
- Pretty much all above treeline
- Fun and pretty open trees down to 6 chair (which is a slow lift)

#### Peak 9
- Similar to peak 7, but mixes in some black runs and green runs
- Trees were not as tight and may allow you to go in and out some
- A few terrain parks

#### W.R.T. Altitude
Breck is way up there - the Imperial lift tops out at 12,840 ft. For 
me as a midwesterner, this means I'm spending an entire day of skiing at a high 
altitude compared to what I'm used to. Combined with this being day 1 of our trip, I 
think I had some issues with altitude, though hard to explain and maybe a bit different 
from how I have heard of altitude
sickness manifesting in others. I tried to drink a ton of water to prevent feeling 
anything, but then I ended up needing to pee a ton throughout the morning. This also 
could have been due to stoke. I also think I got hungry, tried to eat too much too fast, 
and felt weird after eating too. It almost felt like gravity wasn't helping
my digestive tract as much as I'm used to. I'm 
under the impression that altitude sickness 
hits people in a variety of ways though. And 
altitude sickness doesn't distinguish based
on your fitness. It's a wait-and-see sort of thing on how your body might react.

## The human element
Breck feels like it has a family-friendly vibe to it - albeit a rich family. 
Tons and tons of long blue runs can accommodate just about anyone.
There's a good amount of high alpine terrain that makes Breck unique for more
advanced skiers. 
 
### The Crowds
We went to Breckenridge on a Thursday, and there were certainly a lot of people there.
As I stated above, it feels like all of the experts end up waiting at the same few 
lifts and that can make it feel crowded. But I will acknowledge that we never encountered
any of the nightmarish long lines that Vail Resorts have become known for. In retrospect,
I would wager that the longest line we waited in was 15 minutes. That 15-minute line can
be a hard sell when it's for a short (but steep) run though.

### The Amenities
Breckenridge has it all. If you're willing to pay an arm and a leg, I imagine you can
easily stay here. They also have a ton of on-mountain dining options. You could probably
stop to eat or drink at the top or bottom of just about every lift if that's what you're
into. 

For the year 2023, if you had an Epic pass (even one of the day passes), you could get a 
discount on the food (I think 25% off) at any of the dining areas. With the discount,
the food starts to feel a bit more affordable.
