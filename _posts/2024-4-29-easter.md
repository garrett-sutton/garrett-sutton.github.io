For Easter 2024, we packed up the car for a road trip to
Pennsylvania and Maryland. We'd spend the majority of 
the trip with my family in Pennsylvania but were going 
to make a quick trip to my sister-in-law's in the greater
Baltimore/D.C. area for a day as well. This was a new 
travel experience for us and for Gwen. And Gwen was going
to get to meet a bunch of new people!

## Travel details
- Saturday: Drive to my parents in PA (approx 12.5 hours 
total with ~10.5 hours of driving)
- Monday:   Drive to my sister-in-laws outside of 
Baltimore, MD (approx 3 hours from my parents)
- Tuesday: Drive back to my parents in the evening
- Following Monday:  Drive back home (~13 hours total)

## Traveling with a six month old
Driving for long stretches with a six month old was 
obviously new for Grace and I. We wanted to make sure
we were taking care of Gwen appropriately while also
making decent progress. This was especially relevent
for the long stretches to/from Wi-Pa. Luckily, the 
bulk of the drive is on I80/I90 where there are 
plenty of good rest stops. We did some research 
to find rest stops that were approximately 2.5-3 
hours apart and planned to hit those. Once there, 
we could do the normal rest stop things, get Gwen
changed and have her eat.

The night before we left, Gwen had her worst night 
of sleep she had in a while. She was up almost 
every hour and Grace was handling her for the most
part so that I could get some rest for the drive. 
By around 4:30 AM, I got up to try to help out and
brought Gwen to our bed with the intention that
she likely wasn't going to fall asleep and we'd be on
the road within the hour. Probably for the better,
we all fell back asleep for a few hours and didn't get
on the road until 8 AM. Normally, I'd be a bit antsy
about leaving this late, but it was really nice
to get the extra sleep.

On the way to PA, we may have pushed it a little bit
at the start. However, we felt that it was 
unnecessary to stop before Chicago (~2 hours way) and we didn't 
want to stop in Chicago. That left us pushing into 
Indiana. I knew the first rest stop in Indiana wasn't
all that nice, so the plan was to make it ~50 miles
into Indiana where the rest stop would have adequate seating
and be a nice spot for Grace to feed Gwen. We stuck to this
plan even though Gwen woke up upset from a morning nap as we
were making our way through Chicago. Grace went back to
console her, only to find a smelly baby. With nowhere in the
area that we really wanted to stop, we pushed on. Somehow,
Gwen managed to fall back asleep too. We made it to target
rest stop #1. Grace took Gwen in to get changed and started
on eating while I got gas and went to the bathroom. Even
with doing this stuff, I ended up sitting in the rest stop
for a while before Grace and Gwen came out of the bathroom. 
I even went so far as texting Grace to make sure things
were alright. Things were fine, just very poopy. In total,
this stop took an hour. An ominous sign for the rest of
the trip. 

The rest of the trip went smooth though. Gwen slept a good
but not too much amount. Otherwise, she 
did good for most of the ride and only seemed to 
get fussy as we were getting within the last 30ish minutes
of each leg of the journey. Grace was able to hop into 
the back seat with her during those times to calm her
down some. 

With our newfound driving with a baby expertise, we did the
3 hour PA->MD trip in one stretch. This worked about the same
as the trip to PA. Grace fed Gwen right before we left each 
time and then Gwen slept for most of the trip. Smooth sailing!

On the ride home from PA, we stopped at most the same rest stops
as we did on the way in. I think our stops were 
quicker than the east bound
trip even though the trip as a whole seemed to take a bit longer. 
The only additional thing worth noting here is that Gwen slept 
for a ton of the trip back. I think this was likely coupled with
a week+ of poor sleep (more on that later). 

All in all, I think our car travels with Gwen went really well. 
We weren't sure what to expect, but the flexibility of driving
and the loose planning on where to stop along the way helped a 
lot. We had a few toys and things Gwen could look at on the 
drive, but as a 6 month old, we didn't actually need to do that 
much to keep her entertained. Grace and music filled in the times
when she seemed to get bored. Couple all of this with the fact that
our baseline for traveling with Gwen was from 3 months ago (flying
to NY for Christmas), this went swimmingly. 

## Family and friends
Each time we make a trip to my parents, there are always a number 
of people to see in a short amount of time. My mom and dad are both 
from big families, so there are a lot of aunts, uncles, and cousins.
Add in a few friends from high school and it's a packed schedule. 
This trip followed the same theme but with it being Gwen's first 
trip to PA, it was to the Nth degree. One cousin
was at my parents when we arrived at 9:30 PM on Saturday. Another
cousin and her family -- plus grandma -- came for dinner on Sunday (and 
another uncle popped in for a second to say hi too).
2 Aunts & Uncles, plus Granny again, came over for dinner on Wednesday
(for Granny's 89th birthday). Another cousin and her kids came to play
on Thursday morning. And then some family friends were over 
during the day on Thursday. On Friday, the cousin who was over for
dinner on Sunday came back with her 2 little girls to play with
Gwen again. Then another aunt, uncle, and cousin swung by around 
dinner time. Saturday was a friend day. A group of close friends
came to my parents for breakfast and then Grace and I went to play 
games with those friends later that night. On Easter Sunday, yet
another Aunt and her kids came for dinner. 

In addition to the constant flow of people at my parent's house, we
made the daytrip to my sister-in-laws - remember? This was also
really nice. Grace's parents made the trip down from NY while her
brothers came up from D.C. for Monday evening. Sharing a couple of nice 
dinners, exploring their new house and surrounding area, and getting to 
share some laughs with everyone made the trip well worth it. 

Those details are likely
way more than you've probably cared to read, but I highlight it
for my own sake. We're very blessed to have these people in our lives 
and I'd be remiss to not remember them all as part of how nice this
trip was. 

Gwen did extremely well with all of the new faces over the course
of the trip. She played well from all over the place. My aunt
shared a baby bouncer for Gwen to use and she absolutely loved
it. Outside of the bouncer, she was rolling over and nearly sitting up 
unassisted by the end of the week. She even did her first tummy to
back roll (on 3/29)!. She ate super well and continued to 
love the solid food she was given -- I think she just had peas and 
carrots. It felt like you could see her developing significantly
over this course of this week.

## One small hiccup
There is one small piece worth noting that didn't go so well this week. 
I call it small now -- writing this over a month later -- but it
certainly didn't feel small at the time. Gwen's bad night of sleep 
the night before we left for PA seemed to somehow stick with her 
for the entirety of the trip and for about a week when we got back
home. I suspect this is due to a variety of factors (in no particular
order of significance). First, with the constant attention and 
stimulation I've highlighted above, I think she may have just been 
wired. Next, she was getting over a cold and so naturally, her sleep 
was going to be a bit off. Then she was sleeping in the same room
as Grace and I again. We had just moved her to her
crib about 2 weeks prior to this trip. All of this (and I'm sure other 
factors) feel like they contributed to the poor sleep she got during
and after this trip. Even with the poor sleep though, she was a 
really good baby. She was a champ throughout traveling and was
happy all week long.
