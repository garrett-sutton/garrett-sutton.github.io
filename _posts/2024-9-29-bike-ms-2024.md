I commonly say that I think doing hard things
is good for us. And I even get at least a little
enjoyment from doing some hard things.
I also really enjoy spending time riding my bike
as a way to indulge in a "hard thing."

For the past 3 years, I've been able to get a
group together to take part in Bike MS - a 
charity bike ride that supports the National MS
Society. This is a cause that is close to me
because my mom has MS. It's an honor to raise 
money for a good cause and awesome to be able 
to spend time with others doing an activity
that I enjoy.

Typically this ride takes place over the
course of a weekend and we ride anywhere from 
50-100 miles each day. Given it's not a race, 
the "hard things" part of this is largely just
the battle of attrition.

For this year's ride, my dad made the trip to
Wisconsin for us to do the ride near Wisconsin 
Dells (~ an hour from home). Both days offered 
3 loops that were around 25 miles each. You could
ride any number of loops that you wished. On day
1, my dad and I did all 3 loops. This was pretty
miserable by the end. It was super humid, with full sun
and 90 degrees for a good portion of the ride. It's
the type of heat that feels suffocating. By the end,
it felt like I couldn't put anything in my body
that would put any type of power in the pedals. 
Thankfully we made it, but I was crazy tired and sore
by the night. Surprisingly, day 2 went much better -
maybe influenced the fact that we only did 2 loops. 
But also, we hopped on the back of a group and let them do
nearly all of the work for the first 25 miles. It was
also a bit more cloudy, so it didn't feel nearly as
hot. It was nice to get done earlier, beat the heat,
and give my dad and me some additional time to spend with
Gwen and my mom respectively.

This year, more than in other years of doing the ride, felt
like it was really about supporting those with MS. A lot
of announcements were made at the beginning of each day
about the impact of our collective fundraising and 
progress that has been made with MS research and treatment.
Throughout the ride, I interacted with several people
that rode with MS. Each of them expressed their thanks
for us riding. In addition to the fundraising impact,
I hadn't previously considered what it means to these
folks to just show up. I've only been concerned with 
my mom in the past, but it was nice to do something
that could make strangers smile too. 

One guy riding with MS shared his story with my dad and I. 
He had been unable to walk for 18 months early on in his
time with MS. But after starting to exercise he slowly
regained his ability to walk and now, 20+ years later 
he continues to exercise and is able to participate in
the MS ride every year. It was really impressive and
inspiring. I felt humbled after struggling
my way through day 1 of the ride.
