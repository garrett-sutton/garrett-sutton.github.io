## The TLDR
We went to Breckenridge as part of a big family/friend
ski trip in March 2023. This was day 1 of 4 days of skiing on 
our trip. I think my tone around Breckenridge will be generally
critical.

### The would I go back?
I'm not sure that I would. Though there was some great skiing 
to be had, I found it to be a lot of the same - high alpine,
bowl skiing that was sort of difficult to navigate. And given
it's proximity to many other resorts, I could pass on Breck
the next time around. 

## The day
On our trip, we stayed in Frisco, so we caught the bus over to Breck
on a Thursday morning. After we got going, we generally tried to 
complete a north to south path for the day. We started by riding the 
BreckConnect gondola and did the Independence and Freedom chairs
for a few runs while we waited for the Kenosho chair to open. There was
some really fun and playful tree skiing off of one of these chairs. If
I recall correctly Kenosho, it was delayed due to wind. 
Kenosho gets you to peak 6 and it's way out there to the north end of
the resort. I can still vividly feel taking a turn to the north
off of Kenosho over into a wide open bowl with a bunch of pow. 
It's a nearly indescribable feeling as you float on 2 pieces of 
wood. There were a few rocks that poped up along the descent 
that brought me back to reality though. There were several other
runs off of Kenosho that had a similar vibe -- steep open and covered
in largely untracked snow.

After a few runs in this area, I imagine it was getting to be closer 
to lunch time and we still had a long way to go to keep hitting
new areas. To make the traverse faster, we hit up the infamous t-bar.
Dan was not so fortunate with the t-bar. He fell, got yelled at by
the lifty, but cheered on my all of the howling onlookers to never
let go. He eventually had to let go. 

Off of the t-bar, we made our way to the area of Imperial and chair 6. 
Given the wind, Imperial was on and off wind hold all day, but we 
did manage to get a few runs on it. It was busy up in that area, and you
can tell the wind really takes that snow. I remember some pow-like spots 
and soon after bare-ish rock spots. Below Imperial is chair 6, a classic
slow moving lift with pretty much all black runs to get down to it. This 
area was a lot of fun, but the lift line at the bottom paired with the
slow lift ride up made it a hard sell for a group that skis less than
5 times a year. 

After 6, we made it to E-chair and pretty much finished the day with laps
on Peak 9. Peak 9 was a lot of wide open blue-ish runs, some terrain park
action and a limited amount of trees. It was bluebird all day, but felt 
especially so during this time. Crisp air, hard pack and lots of rays to 
soak in. We also saw and heard military jets flying really low around this point.
It's unclear if the Falcon chair was open at all on the day we were there, 
but needless to say if it was, we just didn't have the time to make it 
that far (peak 10). 

We must have gotten on the Peak 8 superchair somehow from Peak 9 
to make the ultra long run down through the village and to the parking lot.

Below, I put together a map that generally looks like the path for the day. It's not supposed to be an exact representation of our day. In addition to giving context to my account from above, I'm using it as a platform to complain a little bit. The high terrain at Breck is super cool, but the lift situation is tough. The longest lifts on the mountain take you up over a lot of mellow terrain to (I'm guestimating) 80% of the way to the top. There are then other much shorter lifts that get you to the highest points. the problem with this is twofold:
1. The expert level runs are pretty short and if you want a long run, you'll have to take multiple lifts to get back to the very top. This makes the navigation between peaks pretty slow. Lesson to learned - If you're looking to get to a certain spot, don't mess around in getting there.
1. The lift lines at these expert level lifts are sort of long. This happens when everyone looking for the expert level terrain ends up lapping these short (but steep) runs.
