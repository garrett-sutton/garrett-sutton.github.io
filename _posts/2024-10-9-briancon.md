For our trip to France in the summer of 2024, we went from the Tour
de France finish in Nice to a small town in the Alps called
Briancon.

## what did we do?
While in Briancon, we had a few "bigger" activities that we wanted
to do but no real plan on when to do them. We had 3 big things
planned and essentially 3 full days, so it worked out well to have
1 thing on our agenda each day and not to push Gwen too hard.

### day 1
This was a "just me" excursion. Briancon is a common point along the
Tour de France because almost all ways out of the town are iconic
climbs - the Col d'Izolard, the Col du Granon, the Col du Lautaret,
and the Col du Galibier. With my interest in the tour and riding
bikes, I wanted to take on one of these legendary
climbs and see for myself how difficult it was. It worked out best
for me to choose the hardest of all of the above - the col de 
granon. The Granon is closest to Briancon, but also the steepest.
It's 11k with an average gradient of over 9%. This is also the 
climb that Jonas broke open the 2022 Tour de France. I've watched
the replay for that stage several times while doing a winter
indoor trainer ride. On that day, the race passed over the Col 
du Telegraphe (category 1), the Col du Galibier (beyond 
categorization), and finished at the top of the
Col du Granon (beyond categorization). Needless to say, I was 
going to have a much easier day. At the same time, I'm a
regular guy who enjoys occasionally riding around my flat home 
roads in Wisconsin. 

I rented a bike from a local shop, got a pack of Oreos from the
local grocery store, and set off. At the base of the climb, I 
stopped for a picture and an Oreo before taking on the beast. 
On the lower slopes, it wasn't terribly steep. I was
still on some of the lowest gears, but I could comfortably pedal at 
7-8 mph. Then I got above the treeline. By then, I was starting
to feel the sustained grade of the lower slopes and now slightly 
steeper slopes. By now, I was working for 5-6 mph. I found some 
motivation in the remnants of painted messages on the road, still
visible from the 2022 stage. 

I wasn't sure if I could pedal the entire way without 
stopping. And though I had been eating my Oreos along the way, I
made a stop 6 km into the climb to take a break, get some more fuel
in me, and take in some scenery. This was also at the start of the
steepest km of the entire climb. Luckily for me, I didn't fall over when
I started again. However, that felt like no small feat at the time. 
Being so steep, it's nearly impossible to pedal with one foot clipped,
so I would have almost certainly fallen over if I hadn't managed
to get my other foot clipped really quickly. If I ever did this again,
I would take the unfortunate step of riding down the mountain long 
enough to get my other foot clipped in and then pull a U-turn to take
on the grade with 2 feet.

The rest of the climb went by slowly and steadily, with 
limited excitement and beautiful scenery all around. 
Near the top, I could tell that it got a little less steep, but in
general I made good friends with the largest cog and 
just had to keep on keeping on.

Eventually, nearly 75 minutes later, I made it to the top - the end of 
the road. At the top, there is a cool little cabin restaurant
with sun chairs and a patio. I snagged a Coke and sparking water
and took in the view from one of the sun chairs. 
The ride down was much quicker than the ride up. It was a lot 
more bumpy too. I guess you just don't notice how not smooth the
road is when you're going so slow. I hung onto the
brakes and let gravity do its thing.

After returning the bike, I met up with Gwen and Grace at a park
next to our Airbnb. This was a nice spot with many kids around playing,
a ropes course, a glacial pond with a small beach and paddleboards, 
and a snack shack. 
Gwen was super happy. This felt different than many parks that 
I've seen in the US; largely due to the volume of people around
at 3 in the afternoon, but also how simple it all seemed. I have
never seen a park in the US with so many free activities. In the US,
it feels like this sort of place would have to cost money and you'd
definitely have to sign waivers to take part.

#### aside on the bike
For my sake, I'm calling out some details on the bike that I rented.
I rented a full carbon Scott bike with a Shimano 105 groupset. I 
regret that I didn't check out the actual model of the bike. I
can guess it was the 2022 Scott Addict 30.

I usually ride a 56 cm bike, but the guy at the bike shop encouraged 
me to get a 54 because that would be more helpful for climbing. I'm
glad I trusted him because the bike seemed to work really well for
me.

### day 2
Today we went for a long hike. The town of Briancon has now grown
since its infancy, but the existing original city was fortified. 
And there
were several fortifications that surrounded the city to alert 
them of any invaders. These forts still exist today
and are a world heritage site. There is a nice trail 
network that connects many of them. 
We put together a route that navigated between several of them 
from our Airbnb and set off with water, snacks, Gwen's necessities 
and Gwen in the carrier. 

It was a nice hike. A good portion of it was shaded and
we got to see some beautiful vantage points of the fortified city
and the valley below. Gwen was also a champ. She took a nap at a
point and was generally happy most of the time!
I did get spooked at a point by a very large dog that came toward us
at a point, but it's owners called it back quickly and thankfully
there is nothing else to write about it.

### day 3
High above Briancon is the Serre Chevalier ski resort. There
is a small chapel near the top of the resort called the 
Notre Dame des Neiges (Our Lady of the Snows). We planned on
taking the cheater way up by riding a gondola to the top 
of the resort to check out the chapel. When we got to the top,
we also decided to make a little excursion of it and take the 
long way to the chapel. It was a beautiful hike with views of the 
valleys below and the Alps looming above. We even got to navigate
through a bit of semi-technical terrain. Grace handled Gwen in the
carrier really well. And Gwen was just a doll for the whole time. 

When we got back to our Airbnb, we got lunch and decided we had 
time in the afternoon to go for a little drive up one of the climbs
that goes out of Briancon. I rode the Granon already and the 
Izolard seems less popular, so we chose the Galibier. The Galibier 
was in this year's tour and is pretty commonly crossed over by 
the tour. To get to the Galibier, we had to take the
long and beautiful ride up the valley (aka the  Col du Lautaret)
to then turn
up the steeps of the Galibier. On the Galibier, it's quite long 
and steep. There were cyclists everywhere. Near the top, there's 
a tunnel that goes through the top of the mountain but there is a
road that also goes over the very top too. I suspect that the
road over the top is used almost exclusively for cyclists and
the tour. 

At the top of the Galibier, there's a little parking lot
and a stunning landscape on both the north and south sides of
the pass. It's super cool to see the road snake its way up 
to the top and read the messages painted on the road by fans
cheering on their favorite riders. In addition to the beautiful
climb up to the top of the Galibier, there are views of the
massive Alps across the valley that seem to go on forever. 
This was a surprise part of our time in Briancon and it really was
a highlight. This was stunning.

## a few small difficulties
Being in a 
foreign country, and especially a small town, I feel like you're
truly immersed in the culture. We definitely struggled with it
at a few points. Probably an obvious point but we certainly
overlooked it until we got there - the language barrier. In 
the remote areas of France, English is much less common. We never
got into any situations that were unsolvable because of a 
language barrier, but many interactions required careful 
consideration of what you said. 

Additionally, food wasn't nearly as easy as we would have expected.
As part of our routine weekends in the US, we'll go to a coffee
shop and commonly get a coffee and breakfast sandwich. In Briancon,
this was never the case. I've heard on podcasts that breakfast in
France is a coffee and a cigarette. I can now believe that. 
On multiple occasions, we went to a nice cafe and could only get
a coffee (no fancy lattes either) and a croissant or chocolate
bread. It was always good, but we all felt like we could have
used some more protein.

We made trips to the grocery store most days, and because it was 
within walking distance, it wasn't too bad. We ultimately had to 
get most of our food to cook at the Airbnb. We could have done
lunch out but ended up eating quickly on most days at the Airbnb.
Dinner was next to impossible to get out because it seemed 
common for restaurants to not open for dinner until 7 pm. Many
people could be seen sitting outside the restaurants before 7 pm,
but they all only had a drink with them. For us, Gwen needed to be
getting close to bedtime by that time. It was better for us
to just eat at the Airbnb. We were able to make food that we were
guaranteed to enjoy too. Grace made a really good chicken
stir fry one night, and I was able to make stovetop steaks another. 

On a few occasions when we were out, we maybe even felt like
we were quietly being watched. One afternoon, we went to the 
town square to get a drink and take in the scene. It was nice
to enjoy the afternoon warmth from under an umbrella and
have Gwen chill in her stroller. I also felt like the couple
next to us was paying close attention to us. If this is even
true, it could be for a variety of reasons - the fact that
we spoke English, but also maybe just that Gwen can be noisy
at points. They never said anything to us, but I never got 
a necessarily nice look from them either. On the occasion of taking
the gondola to the top of the ski resort, we had a lift 
attendant respond to me asking "Can you explain in English?" with
something along the lines of "We are in France, so I speak French"
before finishing her instructions for us in English. It 
felt like an unnecessary snarky response at the time. Both of 
these situations are more highlights of the fact
that I was insecure about not fitting in in this
foreign place. It was truly a unique experience for me.

## did it live up to expectations?
I feel like our time in Briancon was a lot of what we imagined out 
of a town in the Alps. It's a small town with beautiful views all 
around, bakeries, and easy to walk around to everything you could
need. We were able to keep a good balance of busy and relaxed. 
I'd say that much lived up to our expectations. As mentioned above,
there were a few points where we struggled, largely
due to cultural differences. We had the big things planned
like you would for any other trip, but it's some of the little
things that I definitely neglected because I had never traveled
abroad before.
