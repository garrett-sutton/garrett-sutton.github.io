## why did I start it?
With our upcoming trip to France, I've been
trying to make an effort to learn what I 
wasn't taught or have just forgotten since
taking 20th Century History in high school. I figure
that if we are going to visit the historic sites of 
the D-Day landings, the least I can do is have
a baseline understanding of the war as a whole and
some more in-depth knowledge of the Allied effort
to reclaim Western Europe. We started by watching
Band of Brothers on Netflix, which I highly recommend.
This left me looking for more and I found it in 
the form of a book called Engineers of Victory. 
Admittedly, I did the thing that you're explicitly 
told not to do with books -- I judged it by its 
cover. But it worked out for me this time. This was 
a great read.

## what was it?
The author of this book attempts to dive into 
5 distinct parts of World War 2 that eventually
led to the Allied victory over the Axis Powers. It 
can be a tough read at times because it's written
in the form of what I would call a very well 
researched essay. As much as it follows the 
macro picture of the war, it dives into the
specific technologies and processes that ultimately
play a role in shaping history as we know it. To the
author, Allied victory boils down to 5 things:
1. Command of the Air
1. Command of the Sea
1. Stopping an Enemy Blitzkreig
1. How to successfully land on an enemy-held beach
1. Defeating an enemy that is physically displaced
but still your enemy

Though each point above is separate, there is
a certain degree of interconnectedness. The book
makes a strong effort to emphasize these dependencies
while also highlighting that each aspect is by no
means sequential. Winning World War 2 required an
immense amount of parallel strategic planning,
production, and execution.

## what are my takeaways?
### there wasn't just one thing
I haven't necessarily read anything about WW2 that
says a single factor or thing led to the Allied victory,
but this book really emphasizes how many different
factors played a role. I found it interesting that,
from what I understood, it was quite the
opposite; there are so many different pieces that
fit into the puzzle of victory. The leaders, the
planners, the actual soldiers, and the engineers of
the weapons used in the field all play a vital role
in the human aspect of the war. At the same time,
the natural resource-rich US, and technology that
utilized those resources cannot be understated. And 
then, there are the situational factors like weather
and geography that I never considered before 
reading this book. Some of these factors are more
concrete than others. Some contributed to Allied
success and did so entirely out of good luck (e.g. the
dreadful storms over the English Channel immediately
before and soon after D-Day). This
is the prime example of it taking many parts to
make up the whole.  

### parallel war
Often when I have read about WW2, it has been about
the European theater or the Pacific theater. The part
that I never really considered until now is that 
these theaters of war are intimately connected. The US 
had to allocate resources to 
serve both interests at the same time. I imagine it is
challenging to get the right people 
for the job with the right equipment at the right
place at the right time for any war effort. Now add
in the fact that though happening in parallel, 
each theater of war is drastically different (geography, 
enemy, necessary weapons, and consequent planning).

### social engineering
I recently heard the word social engineering and how
it is used in modern-day cybersecurity attacks. My 
understanding is that a threat actor deceives someone 
into doing something that allows them to infiltrate a 
system. This concept is likely old as dirt - people 
tricking other people. But it's interesting to hear
the extent to which the Allies went and the resources they
used to deceive the Germans. The British were
making blow-up armies to get deliberately caught by
German spy missions to convince the Germans of where
they were building up from. The Americans moved General
Patton away from the Normandy landings because the
Germans would surely think he needed to be present
for the Allies to attempt a European invasion. Code
breakers played important roles in informing Naval
personnel of enemy plans and movements. But radio
chatter also presented a great medium for deceiving
the enemy as well. I call out this non-exhaustive
list of deceptions and pieces of intelligence
to highlight that the war wasn't just won by the fact
that the Allies could eventually bulldoze the Axis
Powers. They were also playing a massive game of 
military chess - trying to read the Axis moves while
also making moves themselves that the Axis may take
as bait.

I mentioned Band of Brothers at the onset of this post.
It's the story of the 101st Airborne Division's
Easy Company and their fight from D-Day to VE Day.
They jumped over Normandy during the night hours before
the actual landings began. And the show highlights how
it was sort of chaos. Many men were lost or displaced
and it took a long time for them all to regroup on the 
ground. To the eye, this would appear to be an advantage
Germans. However, this book describes that the 
chaos of the paratroopers being everywhere may 
have been advantageous to the Allies. It was (likely
unintentionally) deceiving to the Germans. 
As US paratroopers were trying
to regroup, the Germans were unable to identify where
any of them were coming from because they were coming
from everywhere. It made responding to the attack 
difficult. 

### winning complex operations
The macro view of the war presented in this book highlights 
how important having a clear operational plan is to the solution
to a problem. In my work, I can see the value
in this. Someone may have a solid understanding of a problem,
good ideas to solve the problem, and the know-how to execute  
those ideas, but none of that matters if we aren't 
able to manage the many moving parts that are necessary to
produce a solution in a timely fashion. The book attributes a lot 
of careful thought and a clear vision of the desired outcome to 
successful operations. Specifically related to operationalizing
a plan, it also highlights the importance of areas of ownership. 
The best plan includes owners of each piece of the plan. This 
allows individuals to remain focused on the particular 
piece of the plan they are responsible for (likely their area of
expertise too) without needing to worry about other parts. It's
the epitome of the old New England Patriots adage - "just do
your job."

### engineers matter
The Allies had superior resources in the latter 
years of the war, but it was the efficient and creative use 
of these resources that truly made a difference in the war. 
And to achieve efficient and creative use of 
resources, it requires a culture of continuous innovation. 
You try, you make mistakes and you learn from those mistakes. 
That isn't done by the people history remembers. It's done by 
the mid-level folks that are doing the designing, 
and building. The ones who are solving problems related to 
the state of the current technology.
I found this to be rather inspirational for my day-to-day. 
Though I am an entry-level software developer right now, 
that might be enough to make an impact on my team, the company,
the industry, and maybe even the world.  

### tech wins
I want to use this section just to list off a few 
pieces of technology that stuck out to me.
- Hobart's Funnies. These armored vehicles were
operated by the British and called the "Funnies" 
nickname because they weren't standard at all. They
were effective at what they were designed to do 
though. One example shined amongst the others to me. 
There was a tank with long tentacle-like chains 
attached to it that would simply thrash the ground
as the tank moved forward to set off any
mines that were in the path of the tank. 
- The Merlin engine in the P-51 Mustang. The politics
of this situation was surprising. In essence, a British
engineer flew a P-51 (American plane) and said it would
be much better with a Merlin engine (British (Rolls Royce)
engine). The US was apprehensive about putting in the
engine because it wasn't our engine.
- The Seabees. These men aren't necessarily a technological
achievement, but they put together an operational masterpiece. The
volume of work that the Seabees completed in such limited 
amounts of time while being shot at is astounding. Granted
it's a different world now than what it was back then, but
during my college summers of working for PennDOT, 
construction was an extremely slow process. The Seabees were
seemingly turning around massive projects at breakneck
speed.
- The aircraft carriers. The US designed and built a ton
of new aircraft carriers that entered service during the
war. Without ever seeing one, it's hard for me to 
truly fathom how big they are. And they move wicked fast
for how big they are. I think there was mention that
somewhere around 100 planes fit below deck.
- The MVP tech (i.e. minimum viable product). The book dives
into how the original
American t-34 tank design wasn't necessarily that good, 
but the Soviets were able to improve it over time to be
one of the war's most formidable weapons. Similarly,   
the American B-29 could outrun Japanese zeroes and
fly higher than any plane before came with, but had it's faults.
I think both of these examples simply highlight that we likely 
aren't going to get it completely right the first time
and we need to leave the door open for future improvements
because you never know - the world may depend on it someday.
- Radar. Radar was extraordinarily important to the British
as they defended themselves in the Battle of Britain. It's a 
two-fold win too. They could spot German planes from 100 miles
away. And they didn't need to use valuable fuel, planes, or 
manpower to do the surveillance. At a time when Britain was
worried about their fuel reserves, this mattered tremendously.

## appendix
Below are the notes I took while reading the book. It's
largely a summary and you can probably find a better
summary elsewhere on the internet, but I'll leave them here
for completeness.

### Battle of the Atlantic

interesting how tech advanced happened so fast and that the 
US/Allies were able to get 
the right ones at the right time. When Germany was pushing 
for more Uboats, the US was 
figuring out a bunch of different things to better equip ships 
and planes to combat them.
crazy how pivotal this is to future success of the war effort. 
Without it, we don't have 
a landing ground in Britain to take back France and push for 
Berlin
some things aren't that big of tech improvements, more of 
optimization. Hedgehogs on 
front of ships (i.e l. Grenade launchers), giving planes 
more fuel tanks, etc

### Command of the air

this talks about the fact that air warfare is new and 
innovative. Similar to what I read in Bomber Mafia

interesting point that British were "ready" for Germans. 
Germans sort of just went for it as a way to eliminate UK.

Radar crazy important during battle of Britain. Can see 
Nazis from 100 miles out. 

1. Don't need to use jet fuel for recon
1. men can rest while waiting for orders

though the British figured out how to fend off they 
failed to recognize some of the advantages they had in 
defending themselves when they attacked Germans
- the morale bit. Thinking they could just crack 
  the Germans
- the homeland bit. Airplanes take a non-trivial 
  amount of time to go back across the channel to refuel

As Rolls Royce got the merlin engine out, there was tension 
with the US about adopting it into the P-51. Seemingly a 
political game that the US wanted our planes to be entirely 
ours even though adding a Merlin to the P-51 would make 
it even better than the spitfire.
This reality of increasing the range of the P51 fighter 
was a huge advantage when it came to needing to fly from 
Britian to Berlin and back. No other fighter could do it.
It was absolutely paramount that the fighters were there 
to escort the long range 
bombers. Otherwise the bombers were sitting ducks.
Strategic bombing became more of a thing as the Allies 
has the resources and 
technologies to carry it out.
They still do the indiscriminate bombing of civilians 
and that is really not all that 
effective.
But hitting key strategic points within Germany are vital 
to the turning the tide. For 
example; the German war industry was still outputting a 
ton of planes and u boats, but 
the allied bombing that inhibitted oil production rendered 
these products useless. By 
hitting railways, they (Germans) also couldn't get things 
to the battlefield

### How to stop a blitzkreig

This chapter goes into depth on how the Nazi blitzkreig was so 
successful in some 
circumstances and how it faultered on the Eastern Front. It's 
interesting because yes, 
there were operational failures, but the Wehrmacht were stretched 
so thin that they 
couldn't overcome those failures. And as they were continuing to 
fight a war on 3 fronts 
(i.e. pulling soldiers from the Eastern Front), the Russians 
continued to pile soldiers 
into the fight.

The blitzkreig tactic was so successful in other places because of 
smaller countries, 
more favorable geography and less prepared armies. In Russia, they 
took heavy heavy 
losses and were pushed back substantially, but they had the luxury 
of moving their 
industrial war complex further to the east. And they laid out mine 
fields all along 
their path. So the nazis strategy of moving very very fast was 
slowed significantly by 
these minefields. Then the geography. Interestingly, the Russian 
land could become so 
muddy that German panzer units (the key to their blitzkreig 
strategy) could end up stuck 
in the mud. The war on the Eastern Front seems to resemble the 
very stagnant battles of 
WW1 - a reality the blitzkreig tried to avoid.

I mentioned this above, but it's particularly interesting to add 
that the total war 
aspect of the war on the eastern front seems to particularly hurt 
the Nazis. The author 
highlights there are many times where german tank divisions are 
forced to sit idly 
because they are simply out of fuel. Like soldiers moving to other 
fronts, this is fuel 
that they either don't have or can't allocate to the eastern front.

I've always heard about "don't go into Russia in the winter" but 
it really plays a major 
role in the German defeat on the Eastern Front.

Also interestingly, the point about a Soviet Tank that was 
originally developed by US 
engineer (the T-34). It had many flaws early on, but with 
additional changes to address 
these flaws, it was a formidable opponent. And most interestingly, 
the Soviet's used it 
as a case for Communism (i.e. we can built the best tank in the 
world because we are 
communist).

The magnitude of the loss of life on the Eastern front is 
staggering.

### How to land on an enemy held beach

This is the chapter of the book that I came for and it's 
fascinating.

This is largely the culmination of the previous chapters, 
especially command of the air 
and command of the sea. Without either of these, DDay is 
impossible.

For years into the war, the Allies seemed to struggle mightily 
with amphibious warfare. 
There are a decent amount of failures and a few successes that 
proceeded Overlord. Even 
the successful missions were sometimes unfair examples to learn 
from. They'd come across 
the Vichy French, a small German force or the Italians. All of 
these to say they weren't 
the most formidable foes. And even with that, the invaders often 
overestimated how many 
people they were fighting against because of the chaos of landing 
on an enemy held 
beach. (One person I think estimated something like 5,000 guns on 
a beach and there were 
only 50?? I'd have to check that). So they could take small 
tidbits from those wins.

There were collosal failures too. Even missions they had no 
strategic purpose but to be 
used as a dry run (to the fury of getting the Canadians into the 
war). Dieppe I believe is the place.

The sheer volume of Operation Overlord is staggering. But even 
with that massive 
advantage, the dug in Germans were still quite 
effective. It was no easy mission.

It truly required command of the sea - being able to shelter the 
landing craft, have a 
place for operational command to be, and a way to 
determinsitically fire on the beaches 
to provide cover for the landing forces.

It truly required command of the air - the landing forces needed 
to be able to focus 
straight ahead and have confidence that the planes overhead were 
there planes.

And then the biggest gamble. The Allies were fearful that land 
forces against the 
Germans would be very difficult. The Germans were magnificent at 
land battles and they 
were even banking on the fact that they were so good at the land 
battles.

Other interesting pieces to victory:

- deception: fooling the Germans into where the invasion would 
happen. With inflatable 
armies, moving Pattona post
- airborne landing all over the place was really hard to do their 
mission but it had an 
unintended benefit. The Germans were confused and surprised by 
people being everywhere
- timing: the speed of the attack was particularly advantageous to 
the allies because 
the Germans couldn't move their best infantry into the area in 
time to make a difference.

Author concludes that the biggest piece is the the 
operationalization of it all. Joint 
command of air, sea and land can't be underestimated. This idea 
wasn't one of the figure 
heads of WW2 but instead the planners before hand

Weather impacting Overlord. Massive storm hit like a week after 
the landing and if it 
was earlier it could have completely derailed the op. Germans 
would have moved people in 
while more people couldn't land for the allies. The Allies 
wouldn't have been able to 
land people because of how bad the water was.

Also the weather was so bad in the days leading into the landings 
that it was postponed 
several times. But June 6 was the first or second day that it was 
sailable. It was so 
quick that the Germans thought it would be Ludacris that the 
allies would invade. So 
much so that some prominent German officers left and went back to 
German for a few days

The tanks that the British had were labeled as funny. They would 
do these crazy things 
like make them carry logs or have chains that they'd use as 
tentacles to set off land 
mines or others that would literally eat hedges

### The pacific theater

Japan's overly ambitous imperial expansion prompts US involvement 
in the Pacific. The 
japanese had ambitions to be labeled as a "greater" nation - in 
line with the great 
powers of europe post ww1. They were expanding into China and the 
world seemed to turn a 
blind eye to it. However, after a while, this expansion prompted 
the US to quit selling 
oil to the Japanese, a vital resource to keeping the island nation 
going. This prompted 
them to attack Pearl harbor with the intention of being able to 
get oil from places that 
they conquered in the Pacific. They figured that if they could 
eliminate the US navy 
from Hawaii, they could more easily expand and obtain the 
resourced they needed to 
continue their expansion into China.

They don't eliminate the US Navy from the Pacific after pearl 
harbor though.

Some of Japan's operational failures and the United State's 
operational and technical 
successes shape the rest of the war in the pacific.

Japan's operation failures:

- not having a unified front between their army and navy
- expanding far beyond what their resources could handle

Contributions to the US success story:

- Putting some resources in China that would occupy the 
substantial Japanese forces 
while focusing a large effort on the Central Pacific theater (The 
Gilberts, Caroline, 
and Mariana Islands) as means to get to the Japanese mainland
- The marines and their specific training around amphibious warfare
- The fast carrier groups. These absolutely massive aircraft 
carriers were remarkably 
effective in transporting planes to allow the US to launch aerial 
attacks from all over. 
The F6F hellcats were designed to land and take off from the Essex 
class carriers and 
they were extraordinarily effective at controlling the skis above 
these aircraft 
carriers.
- The b-29s. These bombers were crazy. They could fly much higher 
than any other plane 
of the time. They could fly faster than most all other Japanese 
fighters too. We used 
them for altitude bombing and the low bombing that was used to 
absolutely devastate 
Tokyo. And B29s were used to carry the A bombs too.
- The seabees -- The Construction Battalions. These groups of 
older service members 
(those who were impressive construction workers in the US - 
building the NYC skyscrapers 
and the like) were able to build airstrips, piers, lodging, 
hospitals, and fuel tanks at 
astonishing rates.
- The submarine service - They operated as part of but also 
independent of the navy.
All of the above coming together at the right time. These pieces 
took time to design, 
build, test and deploy. But they all seemed to be ready to go 
around late 1943 - at 
which point we could use all of the above to overwhelm the 
Japanese forces. It didn't 
make it easy, but it certainly gave us a huge advantage against an 
enemy that had no 
intention on surrendering.
