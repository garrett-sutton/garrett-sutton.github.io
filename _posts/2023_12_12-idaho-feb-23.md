Grace and I have been buying the Mount Bohemia $99 season pass for a 
few years. It's a sweet deal. We can essentially make it worth it by 
making 1 trip to the UP each winter. And that's not to mention Bohemia
is probably the best skiing you can do in the midwest - it's hard, ungroomed, 
and has the potential to get a TON of snow. Another huge perk
with the pass is a large number of partner resorts that give out a day
or so of free skiing for Bohemia pass holders. Naturally, I've been 
eyeing this up for a few years as a "cheap" way to make a trip west. 
This year, the starts finally aligned when I found cheap-ish flights 
into Boise where we could take advantage of free skiing at
Brundage Mountain in McCall, Idaho and Bogus Basin just outside of Boise.

After some hesitation of whether is was really worth it, we set our sites on
a jammed packed weekend trip in early February. At a high level, the travel plan
was:
- Fly out of Milwaukee early on Thursday morning
- Arrive in Boise by midday Thursday
- Drive to McCall from Boise on Thursday (2.5 hours)
- Ski at Brundage on Friday 
- Drive back to Boise on Friday after skiing
- Ski at Bogus Basin on Saturday
- Fly out of Boise at 5:40 AM on Sunday

Back to Bohemia for a second. Mount Bohemia is in my mind what skiing is all 
about. People are there to ski and have fun along the way. The best
amenities are a large hot tub and grungy, sweat 
smelling yurts where the bar is. But another interesting piece of Boho is
the tailgating/camping culture. No matter how cold, tons of people camp at 
Boho. This is admittedly probably because your options are pretty limited. 
You can stay 30-40 minutes way or stay in the yurts - both with the potential of
being a bit expensive. So people camp. We've never done it before, but we figured
what the heck -- this trip to Boise would be the perfec time to figure out how
this works.

So we bought some new gear that could fit in our backingpacking packs and
hopefully keep us warm with the plan of sleeping in the car each night on the
trip. Aside from the obvious fact that it's winter and cold and any time you
travel a warm shower is nice, camping was a good option for us. It was just
the 2 of us (or so we thought -- more on that later), so we could be flexible.
We're also pretty cheap, so not needing to pay for lodging would be sweet. 
And we're skiing. So if you do end up smelling, you have a bunch of layers
on to cover the smell.

The biggest pieces of gear that we bought that are worth noting:
- A sleeping pad with a high R value
     - The R value indicates the pad is made for winter camping
     - The pad is also really really important for warmth because your
     sleeping bag doesn't do the best job keeping the heat in under you 
     (because you're compressing the filling)
     - This probably isn't the biggest deal when sleeping in the car, 
     but would be super important if you were sleeping in a tent on the 
     ground
- A sleeping bag liner.
     - This was huge. I'd never heard of these before but they allege that
     the liner can add ~15 degrees to your sleeping bag's temp rating

Short aside to address the comment about this trip being just the 2 of us.
We planned this trip sort of late, but then even closer to (like a week
before leaving) we found out Grace was PREGNANT. That's probably worth its
own post. 

Nevertheless, a few days later we're sitting at Caribou coffee for a long layover in
the Minneapolis airport (a theme for our travels through MSP). Also, plug.
The MSP bathrooms are awesome. Highly recommend sitting in MSP if you get
a choice of which airport you'd HAVE to sit in (I'm not crazy - I don't 
enjoy sitting in airports, but this is less bad than ususal). 

On the decent into Boise, I'm thinking it looks like there is no snow anywhere
near this town. It's sort of a worrisome feeling -- spending a fair amount of money,
taking a few days off work, traveling with a pregnant lady -- to not know if you'll
even be able to accomplish the goal of the trip -- skiing. A comical story
from the Boise airport. I head down to the rental car counter and the enterprise guy
says that I get a free upgrade (I originally booked a Full size SUV). I can choose 
between a brand new Buick Enclave or a Chevy Suburban. Without second though, I opt
for the Suburban. It's the natural choice -- a suburban home in the mountains with 
a lot of space for our gear. The guy responds, "How many poeple are with you?" and when
I say "Just my wife and I" we gave me sort of a look of bewilderment. Like what the
heck does this guy need this car for. I'm totally speculating, but like to think it
this way.

We stopped at Walmart to pickup the pickup order we placed beforehand and headed North
for McCall. It took a while for any snow to appear, but after heading through some 
pretty narrow roads and climbing quite a bit, we were in it. It was an absolutely 
gorgeous drive and a gorgeous day to do it. A ton of snow and bluebird skies all around.

We stopped at a spot called [Frenchies] on getting to McCall and watched the Wisconsin
basketball team beat Ohio State while we ate. Then it was time to test our mettle. We drove
up out of town to the Brundage Mountain resort to find the parking lot completely empty, other
than maybe 2 other cars. It seemed safe to just pick whatever spot you wanted that was out of
the way. We got our stuff ourganized on our suburban home by pulling out sleeping
pads, liners and bags. We opted for warm base layers with a winter hat so that we could let the
sleeping bag and liner do their thing in keeping us warm. We'd read beforehand that
having too many clothes on could end up getting you cold. Once set, we opened the windows 
a crack to promote some air flow our home and hit the hay. I've personally never slept
outside when it was that cold. I think that I slept fairly well, but I also woke up 
several times really hoping it was close to morning. When morning finally came, it was 15 degrees.
We survived -- aside from an aboslutely wicked fart that Grace to this day blames on Gwen!
