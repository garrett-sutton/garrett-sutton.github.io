# 12/9/23 Why do this 
Why do I want to spend any amount of time on a computer writing down
my thoughts to no one after I spend at least 40 hours per week looking 
at a computer and am objectively bad at writing down my thoughts? 

## Communication
As I have transitioned to working as a software developer, I've especially
come to realize the importance of language and communication even in
technical work. I notice that some folks I work with are
really good at articulating their thoughts and can tell it positively 
influences their work as a whole. I'm oftentimes impressed
when I read technical references or internal design documents 
that are clear and consice. 

I tend to ramble in my words and stumble through writing. In less 
serious situations, this leads to Grace (my wife) and other loved
ones often asking "when is the punch line coming?"  I hope
that doing more writing myself will help me to use language
more precisely in all facets of life.  

## Telling stories
I listened to this [Keep Hammering Collective podcast] in December 2023
and a few things stuck out to me. 

First, I was drawn to this podcast
because it had adventure written all over it. I've had a bit of cabin
fever recently for various reasons -- being inside a lot with Gwen,
thinking about the past summer of riding bikes, dreaming of fresh POW
in the winter, and hearing my dad talk about his obsessive hunting season 
in PA. In the past, I've sought podcasts to fulfill this itch when I know
the next big adventure is potentially a long ways off. Some are better than
others at actually telling their stories. But for this one, they killed it.
Telling stories about hunting in `The Last Frontier` definitely hit the spot.

Secondly and more importantly,
there was a segment in this podcast where the interviewee, Cole Kramer, 
talks through the fact that he doesn't write down all of the hunts that he guides. 
He was by no means proud of this though. He mentioned that one of his mentors 
had encouraged him to write things down because even though you think you'll
remember it, you probably won't. I took this pretty seriously on hearing it.
I don't necessarily live the most interesting life to the outside world. It's 
commonly filled with a pretty consistent regular person routine - wake up, 
run, go to work, come home to Garce & Gwen, sleep and repeat. However, I realize that
high adventure is not every day for most people. High adventure and noteworthy
events in one's life are also relative. I hope that I'll use this project as 
an opportunity to write about those experiences that simply stick out to me.
At the very least, I think it will be a lot of fun (and likely humourous) to read 
my own account of my own history. At most, I might learn something for the
next time.

### A note on obsessives 
In October 2023, I read *Bomber Mafia* by Malcolm Gladwell. In it, he talks
about being obsessed with military airplanes as a kid and as
he's writing this book, he talks to Air Force generals who are even more obsessed with
airplanes period. The detail of airplanes doesn't matter to this point, but Gladwell
calls these sorts of people (the generals), "obsessives." Whether they know it or not,
their obsessive interest in a thing is interesting to others. It's also what makes them tick.  

I think that by writing down stories, recaps and what I've learned is sort of 
an obsessive endeavor. It feels like a sort of pursuit of continually improving my
baseline understanding of the thing I'm writing about. And even if I'm only writing
a story, I think that the details in that story likely lend to some other topic that
I could have a deeper understanding of. I hope to portray some of my obsessiveness on
various topics as I work on this project. 

## Something technical
As I have worked through UW computer science courses and started work 
as an software developer at Epic, I have wanted to figure out some sort of at-home project
that I could work on that would flex some technical muscles. I realize that writing markdown
files is not a technical endeavor, but I hope that after writing for some time,
 I'll be able to generate some ideas around how to use this content. And there is
always something to learn while using git for version control. 

Given the subject of this content is free flowing, I may even end up writing some
about technical topics that I'm generally interested in learning more about or 
I could use for at home projects. Having a space to document what
I learn will be good for future reference and experimentation.
