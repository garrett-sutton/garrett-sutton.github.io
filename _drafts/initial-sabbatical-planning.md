## Early vision
Early on in my time of working at Epic, I started 
dreaming up where we would go for sabbatical. At
5 years of tenure, employees at Epic can take a 
month-long sabbatical to visit any country in 
the world that you haven't been to before. 
You can also take the it as 2 two-week trips
that are a year a part. Regardless of how you take
it, Epic will provide per deim pay during the 
trip and pay for some (or maybe even all) of your 
flight expenses. I started at Epic in July 2019, 
which made me due to for sabbatical in July 2024.

During COVID, I discovered professional cycling. 
For some reason, one day early on in the Tour de France,
I decided to turn the race on while I was working. From that
point forward, I was hooked. I watched every day for
the next 2+ weeks. It had to help that this
was Tadej Pogacar's first tour and concluded with his
mesmerizing TT to win. 

Separately, I run a lot. From starting
off with the Mountain Top track and field club to 
running cross country in college, running has always been
a part of me. And I've thoroughly enjoyed a lot of running
literature over the years - from fiction books like 
Once a Runner, to training philosophies, to following
pros in their constant pursuit of the Olympics. Though
I more closely follow major American sports most
of the time, I love watching the Olympics on TV when the
time comes. It's a fantastic celebration of world
and it's always fun to get to know and cheer for the 
many American athletes. 

And now the icing on the cake. The Tour de France typically
ends on the Champs Elysees in Paris in mid-to-late July and
the 2024 Summer Olympics (usually starting in late July or early
August) would be held in Paris. From here on out, France
was my dream destination given the perfect coincidence.
