I started watching the Tour de France as something
to do during covid. That also happened to be the 
year that Tadej Pogacar burst onto the scene
and made up over a minute on an epic stage 20
time trial to beat Primoz Roglic and win the tour.
I've been drawn to the suffering, the tactics, and the
beauty of the scenery ever since. So when I was 
working through ideas on where to go for my
sabbatical for work, seeing the tour de France in 
person was high on my list. As we got closer, I was
admittedly a bit nervous about how fun it could
really be. I contend that with modern television,
sporting events might be nicer to watch from your 
couch. There's in-depth analysis, awareness beyond
what your eye can see from reporters, and the
camera angles are incredible. And with the tour,
being there in person felt like it would miss the mark
on all of those points. There's no broadcast
for me to watch and follow along with. And there's a
single "camera" angle - your own eyes for ~5 seconds
until the riders are gone. Even after being there
for 3 stages, I think all of those presumptions are still 
true. The tour is a lot of fun to watch from your couch.
But it was truly a remarkable experience to see in
person.
