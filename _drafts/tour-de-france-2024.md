I started watching the Tour de France as something
to do during covid. That also happened to be the 
year that Tadej Pogacar burst onto the scene
and made up over a minute on an epic stage 20
time trial to beat Primoz Roglic and win the tour.
I've been drawn to the suffering, the tactics, and the
beauty of the scenery ever since. So when I was 
working through ideas on where to go for my
sabbatical for work, seeing the tour de France in 
person was high on my list. As we got closer, I was
admittedly a bit nervous about how fun it could
really be. I contend that with modern television,
sporting events might be nicer to watch from your 
couch. There's in-depth analysis, awareness beyond
what your eye can see from reporters, and the
camera angles are incredible. And with the tour,
being there in person felt like it would miss the mark
on all of those points. There's no broadcast
for me to watch and follow along with. And there's a
single "camera" angle - your own eyes for ~5 seconds
until the riders are gone. Even after being there
for 3 stages, I think all of those presumptions are still 
true. The tour is a lot of fun to watch from your couch.
But it was truly a remarkable experience to see in
person. 

## stages
We went to stage 19, 20, and 21 of this year's Tour de
France. 

### isola - stage 19
Isola is a small town close to the Italian border in the 
Southern Alps. It was about a 1 hour drive from where we
were staying. We left in the late morning to drive 
there. It was a beautfiul drive all along the way. As
we got closer (inside of 15 miles), I started to notice a
fair amount of people parking and riding their bikes - bike 
gangs, mountain bikes, solo bikes, nice bikes, electoric bikes.
People seemed to just pack some extra
shoes and a shirt for the day of hanging around for the tour
and then ride back to their car. 
It would definitely have been nice to not have to worry about 
parking. I had been stressing for days that we were going
to get to this town and not
have a place to park. As we got closer and closer,
traffic continued to be dense and things looked bleak.
Luckily, we found a spot about a mile away from town.
This village of isola was at the base of the final 
climb on today's stage -- 15 km from the finish.

We walked into the village, Grace carrying Gwen in the
carrier and me carrying the backpack/diaper bag. We had 
some time until even the caravan came through. The 
village felt like exactly what you'd expect of a small
alpine French village -- narrow cobblestone streets,
a square with seating, and a few small mom & pop businesses.
It seemed like even though this little town knew that
the tour was coming through, they were still overwhelmed.
With some fear of being unable to communicate (and lack of 
service), we ended up waiting in line to get into a small
grocery store to stock up for the rest of our day. 

After acquring lunch, we went to a small park along the course
so that Gwen could move around a bit. And this is when
the real fun started.

I have been aware of the tour de France caravan, but it's 
never on TV and I just assumed it was a few cars that
came through ceremoniously. My assumption couldn't have 
been more wrong. We were sitting in this park when the caravan
started making its way through and I started walking over
to the side of the road just to see what it was all about. I no 
more than started walking when the first cars
started chucking all sorts of goodies along the road. Like a 
small child, I took off to see what I could get my hands on. They 
threw everything from bucket hats for each of the Tour jersey's to
small snacks to dishwasher detergent. It's a huge marketing thing
where all of the sponsors create these fleets of parade floats 
and throw out all sorts of stuff every single day of the tour. 
Some people walked away with mountains of stuff. It was so 
surprising to see such a thing as an American. I'm so used to going
to sporting events and they throw out like 5 T-shirts to the 
entire crowd. The Tour de France caravan couldn't be more different.
It felt like they wanted everyone to have something. Truly, the
caravan was a real highlight. It set the stage for a lot of fun
today and in the days ahead.

After the caravan, it took about an hour or so for the race
to come through. With ridiculously bad service (thanks Verizon),
it was hard to keep track of the race. We found the Uno X 
team had a private party with a big screen outside that we 
could see from the road. That was the best we could do. It was
also nicely situated next to this river that came down out of
the mountains. Though it wasn't overly hot (or sunny), standing
on the bridge over the river provided a nice coolness to the air. 

It was really cool to feel the anticipation build as the race 
got closer and eventually made it's way through. As expected,
the riders were there and gone in a really short amount of
time. After the breakaway and GC guys passed through, 
we made the short walk back up to the village square where they
had another big screen set up. A lot of other people did the
same. There was a lot of energy in the crowd and it was 
specifically exciting for us because the young American, Matteo
Jorgenson, had made his way solo off the front. Unfortunately
for him and for us on that day, Tadej is an assassin and 
managed to make up several minutes in the last few kms to win.
Though almost only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades,
it was cool to see Matteo almost win and eventually come
in second on the stage. All while this was happening, the crowd
built up around us and there was a lot of excitement. Some
Slovenian fans were sitting directly in front of us, but they 
weren't the only ones pulling for Tadej to win. It's strange.
On any other day, I would be hyped to see him do something
that is seemingly superhuman. But it stunk to have an American
be his victim on this day. I call out fans cheering for Pogi
here because it's very clear that even though he's seems
far and away the favorite to win almost every race he enters,
he is also a real fan favorite. People -- myself included --
really seem to love his uncanny ability on a bike and
youthful exuberance. 


TODO: add pic in Isola

### la colmiane  - stage 20
Lucky for us, we didn't have to do any driving for Stage 20.
We were staying in an airbnb located at the top of the second
to last climb of the stage - la colmiane. 

After our surprise expereince with the caravan yesterday,
we made it a priority to see again. We set up shop in what seemed
like a decent spot right before the king of teh mountains 
banner. Prior to the caravan even coming through, we were
gifted with another surprise. The polka dot sponsor and this 
orange soda sponsor came through handing SO MUCH STUFF. The 
polka dot sponsor had a whole truck full of polka dot shirts
and I estimate they gave away thousands of them. When I asked for
2, they handed them over without question. I suspect they hand
out all of these shirts to make the TV shot look really good
at the top of the moutains with everyone in polka dots.
And then the Orangina truck was a similar story. They initially 
started handing out 
individual cans but that was overwhelming for the distributors.
It was a ton of people crowding around with arms outreached hoping 
for one to be handed to them. As time went on, they just started
handing out full cases of orange soda. I managed to snag one of
these. It was quite funny. As I walked back to Grace and Gwen,
I managed to get rid of the whole thing, save the 2 that I kept
for Grace and I. While we continued waiting for the actual caravan,
we met some women from the US which was a welcome conversation.
The caravan passed through with more excitement. We snagged
a lot less goodies today, but it was still a fun time. 

In an effort to explore a little bit, we walked our way down the 
climb to see if there was a better spot to watch
the race come through. What we found was the quntesential 
Tour de France viewing spot - within the masses, near the top of
a major climb, shaded grassy area in the woods right next to the
road. So rather than needing to stand next to the course to 
maintain a spot in the baking sun, we could sit in the shade
and relax while we waited for the race to come through. It was 
really cool to look up and down the climb from our spot and see
all of the other fans packed along the road also waiting for
the race. 

When the race came through, it was all strung out. They passed
us a little bit slower today but they were still flying. You
could catch glimpses of most everyone. With the race being 
strung out, it wasn't a big deal to be out in the road. You 
simply took a step back when the polic motorbikes came through
and then a single file line of riders would fly past. This continued
for a little while. And then the groupetto came through. I 
sort of panicked becasue I had to actually jump off the road to
get out of the way instead of just taking a step backwards. 

TOdo: ADD PICTURE OF THE CLIMB

Once the whole race came through, we walked up to the top of the
climb where another big screen had been set up that was showing 
the race. It was really cool to see everyone else also make their
way up and find a spot to watch the last climb. It became
a small stadium of sorts where everyone was glued to the tv.
Again, everyone seemed to be cheering for Tadej and again Tadej 
delivered - this time out deuling Jonas in the last few hundred 
meters.
