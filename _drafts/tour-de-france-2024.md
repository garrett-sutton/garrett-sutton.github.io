I started watching the Tour de France as something
to do during covid. That also happened to be the 
year that Tadej Pogacar burst onto the scene
and made up over a minute on an epic stage 20
time trial to beat Primoz Roglic and win the tour.
I've been drawn to the suffering, the tactics, and the
beauty of the scenery ever since. So when I was 
working through ideas on where to go for my
sabbatical for work, seeing the tour de France in 
person was high on my list. As we got closer, I was
admittedly a bit nervous about how fun it could
really be. I contend that with modern television,
sporting events might be nicer to watch from your 
couch. There's in-depth analysis, awareness beyond
what your eye can see from reporters, and the
camera angles are incredible. And with the tour,
being there in person felt like it would miss the mark
on all of those points. There's no broadcast
for me to watch and follow along with. And there's a
single "camera" angle - your own eyes for ~5 seconds
until the riders are gone. Even after being there
for 3 stages, I think all of those presumptions are still 
true. The tour is a lot of fun to watch from your couch.
But it was truly a remarkable experience to see in
person. 

## stages
We went to stage 19, 20, and 21 of this year's Tour de
France. 

### isola - stage 19
Isola is a small town close to the Italian border in the 
Southern Alps. It was about a 1 hour drive from where we
were staying. We left in the late morning to drive 
there. It was a beautfiul drive all along the way. As
we got closer (inside of 15 miles), I started to notice a
fair amount of people parking and riding their bikes - bike 
gangs, mountain bikes, solo bikes, nice bikes, electoric bikes.
People seemed to just pack some extra
shoes and a shirt for the day of hanging around for the tour
and then ride back to their car. 
It would definitely have been nice to not have to worry about 
parking. I had been stressing for days that we were going
to get to this town and not
have a place to park. As we got closer and closer,
traffic continued to be dense and things looked bleak.
Luckily, we found a spot about a mile away from town.
This village of isola was at the base of the final 
climb on today's stage -- 15 km from the finish.

We walked into the village, Grace carrying Gwen in the
carrier and me carrying the backpack/diaper bag. We had 
some time until even the caravan came through. The 
village felt like exactly what you'd expect of a small
alpine French village -- narrow cobblestone streets,
a square with seating, and a few small mom & pop businesses.
It seemed like even though this little town knew that
the tour was coming through, they were still overwhelmed.
With some fear of being unable to communicate (and lack of 
service), we ended up waiting in line to get into a small
grocery store to stock up for the rest of our day. 

After acquring lunch, we went to a small park along the course
so that Gwen could move around a bit. And this is when
the real fun started.

I have been aware of the tour de France caravan, but it's 
never on TV and I just assumed it was a few cars that
came through ceremoniously. My assumption couldn't have 
been more wrong. We were sitting in this park when the caravan
started making its way through and I started walking over
to the side of the road just to see what it was all about. I no 
more than started walking when the first cars
started chucking all sorts of goodies along the road. Like a 
small child, I took off to see what I could get my hands on. They 
threw everything from bucket hats for each of the Tour jersey's to
small snacks to dishwasher detergent. It's a huge marketing thing
where all of the sponsors create these fleets of parade floats 
and throw out all sorts of stuff every single day of the tour. 
Some people walked away with mountains of stuff. It was so 
surprising to see such a thing as an American. I'm so used to going
to sporting events and they throw out like 5 T-shirts to the 
entire crowd. The Tour de France caravan couldn't be more different.
It felt like they wanted everyone to have something. Truly, the
caravan was a real highlight. It set the stage for a lot of fun
today and in the days ahead.

After the caravan, it took about an hour or so for the race
to come through. With ridiculously bad service (thanks Verizon),
it was hard to keep track of the race. We found the Uno X 
team had a private party with a big screen outside that we 
could see from the road. That was the best we could do. It was
also nicely situated next to this river that came down out of
the mountains. Though it wasn't overly hot (or sunny), standing
on the bridge over the river provided a nice coolness to the air. 

It was really cool to feel the anticipation build as the race 
got closer and eventually made it's way through. As expected,
the riders were there and gone in a really short amount of
time. After the breakaway and GC guys passed through, 
we made the short walk back up to the village square where they
had another big screen set up. A lot of other people did the
same. There was a lot of energy in the crowd and it was 
specifically exciting for us because the young American, Matteo
Jorgenson, had made his way solo off the front. Unfortunately
for him and for us on that day, Tadej is an assassin and 
managed to make up several minutes in the last few kms to win.
Though almost only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades,
it was cool to see Matteo almost win and eventually come
in second on the stage. All while this was happening, the crowd
built up around us and there was a lot of excitement. Some
Slovenian fans were sitting directly in front of us, but they 
weren't the only ones pulling for Tadej to win. It's strange.
On any other day, I would be hyped to see him do something
that is seemingly superhuman. But it stunk to have an American
be his victim on this day. I call out fans cheering for Pogi
here because it's very clear that even though he's seems
far and away the favorite to win almost every race he enters,
he is also a real fan favorite. People -- myself included --
really seem to love his uncanny ability on a bike and
youthful exuberance.
