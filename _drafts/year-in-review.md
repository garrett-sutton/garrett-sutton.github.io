While visiting Grace's family for Christmas 2023,
we played a game were everyone picked a song that
they identified with. After much deliberation,
I landed on *Whole Lotta Love* by Led Zeppelin based
solely on the title. There's not really any other way 
to put it. I was so blessed with a whole lotta love 
in 2023. 

Below is mostly a list of the whole lotta love that 
I experienced during 2023. If there is more to it 
than simply the note, I'll try to provide a little bit of 
commentary.

## January
* On January 29, 2023, Grace took her first pregnancy test
and ...she PASSED. A lot of emotions ensued.

## February
* Grace and I went on a quick skiing trip to Idaho. Check
out my post about this [here](../_posts/2023-12-12-idaho-feb-23.md). 

## March
* We went skiing in Colorado with family and friends
   * Grace's family minus David, my family, my cousins 
   Travis and Elliot, and friends Will, Kayla, Dan & 
   Emily (sister) Roberts.
   * Check out some my resort reviews under "skiing" for a 
   peek into the gnarly details.
* After the day of skiing at Vail, we revealed to everyone that
   we were expecting a baby! 

## April
* I continued my likely unsustainable tradition of running
my age in KMs on or near my birthday. This year I ran
over 26 KM for 26 years on Saturday April 8. Grace did the 
first 10 with me and Eric did the whole thing.
* My birthday - April 9 - was on Easter Sunday for the first time
in my lifetime.
* I navigated the craziness of Boston on Patriot's Day with my
in-laws to watch Grace absolutely crush the Boston Marathon
at nearly 3 months pregnant.

## May

## June
* We found out baby Sutton would be baby girl Sutton
via a reveal cake from McKinney & Doyle at Grace's
parents.
   * My parents say the gender first - a few weeks 
   prior - and then called in the cake color. 
* We went to Chicago for a weekend to watch a Cubs
game at Wrigley and hang out with Eric, Jordan (college
roommate), Anna, and Blake. Wrigley was quite 
possibly the coolest ballpark I have ever been to - an
admittedly small sample of Progressive in Cleveland, Am 
Fam in Milwaukee, and PNC in Pittsburgh. We also went
to the Starbucks Roastery and it was
not as big of a thing as I expected it to be.

* In late June, I undertook the overly ambitious 
journey of driving to Toledo, Ohio for a weekend
to do Bike MS. 
   * Grace and I left Madison after work on Friday
   and I returned after finishing the ride on 
   Sunday (150 miles of pedaling later). Grace continued
   East with Maddie B.
   * Joe, Justin, and my Dad rode this year. We slept on 
   a gym floor and missed lunch on day 1. It was a fun 
   time.

## July
* A week after Bike MS in Toledo, I drove from home in 
Madison to Erie, PA to get Grace from Maddie's and then 
drove the rest of the way to my parent's house in 
central PA. 
   * During this trip home, Dan and I did a 
    gravel/road bike ride that climbed up Lilly Mountain
    and Cresson Mountain. It was hard, beautiful, and
    so fun. I hope I never forget it.
* Baby talk became more and more real. We went back to 
Pawling for a baby shower. It was nice to get to see
Grace's family, a few friends and the few that traveled 
from my family - Mom & Granny, Aunt Marg, Uncle Chipper,
Aunt Laverne, and Uncle Marty.

## August
* Abbey and Nik visited for a weekend.
* We went to a Brewers game against the Pirates. Though
I was never a big pirates fan growing up, it felt
a little weird to be rooting against them.

## September
* Neil visited for a weekend and we went to Luke 
Fickell's first game as the Badger head coach. I 
believe it was also the hottest game in the history
of Camp Randall Stadium. 
* Gwen was due on September 28.  
* After a few long years of hard work (3+ to
be exact), I officially
transferred into the software developer role at Epic.

## October
* Gwen arrived on October 3, 2023 at 3:48 AM. 
* Gwen was baptized on October 21, 2023 at Saint
Maria Goretti Catholic Church. All of her grandparents
and Maddie & Conner (Godparents) were able to make it.

## November
* My mom came for an extended stay around Thanksgiving. 
She got here on Tuesday November 14. My Dad and Neil arrived the day before Thanksgiving. Neil met Gwen during
this time. They headed back to PA on Saturday.

## December
* We flew to NY for Christmas, then to Georgia for Dan's
wedding and back to MKE. See [my post about it here](../_posts/2024-1-23-christmas-2023.md)
