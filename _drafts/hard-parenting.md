## oh no, a sick kid

It all started on Saturday evening. Grace was getting out the 
door for a coworkers dance recital and helping me get Gwen 
started with dinner. Gwen was being a little bit picky about 
food but it was hard to say what might be doing it. Eventually 
after Grace had left, I gave her a fork and she chomped down
chicken and pears like it was no one's business. And all seemed 
good. I took her out of the high chair and let her play around 
as i was getting things cleaned up. She was being a bit needy 
and I was going to just pick her up and move her to her toys 
so that I could maneuver in the kitchen a little quicker. But 
as soon as I picked her up, she blew chunks EVERYWHERE. She 
was covered. I was coverd. The floor was especially covered.
This made her spitting problem as a newborn seem trivial.

I frantically ran her over to the bathtub so that we could 
contain the mess. I had to unload all of our dirty running 
clothes out of the bathtub with her in tow but managed. After 
I put her in the tub (no water), she was generally happy. I 
got her cleaned up a bit and actually took her back out so 
that I could clean things up. Taht worked well. After cleaning 
up, I put her in the bath for a long time and she had fun as 
usual. She got into a sleeper, and I did notice that as I was 
killing some time for her to go to bed, she spit up again 
(mostly watery this time). Thinking about to her younger days, 
I just stood with her on my shoulder and patted her back to 
hopefully get something out of necessary before she went to 
bed. Nothing ever came out and she fell asleep on my shoulder. 
I laid her down in her crib.

I was working on cleaning up further when I heard her start 
crying in her room. She wakes up soon after going to bed 
sometimes and usually that just means she needs a binky. 
However, I knew that wasn't the case tonight. I went in to 
find a huge pile of puke and more running down the front of 
her sleeper. Poor little girl. I tried to grab the pool of 
puke with a burp cloth and then stripped her down to start 
the cleaning process. Needing to put her somewhere while I 
got her situated, I just sat her on the ground in her diaper. 
I was trying to calm her down and figure out what to do next. 
She was exhaused. At a point, I was rubbing her back and she 
laid her head down on my foot and started to fall asleep. So 
I put her in a new sleeper, laid a blanket out on the floor 
with the hope that she would throw up on that rather than 
the floor if she needed to again, and she passed out 
immediately.

I got to work with cleaning up stuff and luckily Grace got 
home. We worked to get her pack'n'plat set up (the mattress 
cover in her crib was in serious need of the washer) and 
covered the pad with plastic so that if she did spit again 
only the sheet would be gone. Grace moved Gwen off of the 
floor and pretty much instantly she spit up some. Another 
new sheet. This time she sat up with Grace for a while, 
fell alseep again with her and then laid down fine after 
that. She only woke up 1 more time and at that point she 
actually did just need a binky.

A bit crazy for a Saturday night, but all is good. It's ironic 
that I was touting this weekend as a weekend we had nothing 
to do for the first time in over a month.

## a relatively normal Sunday

Gwen was a bit picky with food. She had some pancake before 
Church and threw up some of it but not that much. Later on 
she had a few saltines and threw those up too. But during 
all of this she never seemed that upset. She took a long 
nap in the morning and a short one in the afternoon, but 
again nothing too out of the ordinary other than she wasn't 
eating that much. Eventually we got to dinner time and she 
ate great. Grace made a really good sausage and squash soup. 
Gwen went to bed just a little bit after eating and we 
figured we were in the clear.

Grace wasn't feeling that great after church this morning. 
She took a long nap while Gwen slept too and complained of 
being nauseous a little bit but she didn't ever throw up. 
I think by the end of the day she was feeling pretty much 
fine.

## a not so normal Monday

I woke up to pee at about 3 am. And after returning 
to bed I laid there for a while (maybe slept a bit), 
I started to realize that my stomach was not in a 
good way. I got up to go to the bathroom knowing that I 
needed to throw up. And sure enough, I threw up a lot. 
This continued for a long time. I couldn't ever get 
back in bed because every time I moved a lot and then 
laid down I would just need to throw up again. Water 
was not helpful to me at all. In fact, I felt like it 
was making me throw up. I just sort of sat on the 
bathroom floor for upwards of 3 hours. I had to go 
2 a few times and that would subsequently be followed 
by needing to throw up. The throw up became a lot less 
numerous and a lot more painful. It was seemingly just
bile that I was getting out - GROSS and painful.

By around 8 am, I think i got back into bed and propped
myself on some pillows and continued to sleep on and 
off until noon. I don't think I have ever done such a 
thing. Grace and Gwen also stayed home, largely as a 
precautionary measure to make sure Gwen didn't get 
anyone at daycare sick.

I woke up to find that Grace had also threw up during 
the morning when changing one of Gwen's diapers. This 
was bad news. Somehow she championed on through some 
more work and let me sleep.

I eventually got out of bed and was feeling a bit better. 
Grace handled Gwen most of the way through lunch until 
she made her an egg that set her over the edge. I filled 
in for a little while. Grace came back out and did more 
with Gwen while I laid on the couch until she put her 
to sleep for an afternoon nap. Then Grace also went to 
sleep.

Gwen awoke after maybe an hour. Her and I played in 
her room for a while. Seh lost it as a point when she 
bumped herself in the face with a book, Grace came 
over and suggested that we eat some food. Around this 
point, I was starting to feel worse again. All I 
could bring myself to put together was crackers and 
cheerios. I could hear Grace get up to throw up at a 
point and ran over to check on her. Gwen was seriously 
freaked. No poop or throw up for me but just achey 
all over and generally tired. I got Gwen into her 
playpen and laid with her for a while trying to close 
my eyes as she played. She did a really nice job of it, 
but eventually needed to eat again. I heated up that oh 
so good sausage and squash soup for dinner and it was 
painful to get her to eat. It couldn't have seemed less 
apetizing this time around. Gwen finished eating and 
played around for a while as Grace and I both sat 
miserably on the couch. Grace is a hero for eventually 
bathing Gwen and getting her dressed for bed. Gwen 
was super good after this. Playing with her books 
and moving about. Eventually you could tell she was 
tired and I laid her down to go to sleep.

What a day. The tag team effort while both Grace and 
I felt horrible was something.
