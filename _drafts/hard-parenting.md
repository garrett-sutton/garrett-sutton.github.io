## oh no, a sick kid

It all started on Saturday evening. Grace was getting out the 
door for a coworkers dance recital and helping me get Gwen 
started with dinner. Gwen was being a little bit picky about 
food but it was hard to say what might be doing it. Eventually 
after Grace had left, I gave her a fork and she chomped down
chicken and pears like it was no one's business. And all seemed 
good. I took her out of the high chair and let her play around 
as i was getting things cleaned up. She was being a bit needy 
and I was going to just pick her up and move her to her toys 
so that I could maneuver in the kitchen a little quicker. But 
as soon as I picked her up, she blew chunks EVERYWHERE. She 
was covered. I was coverd. The floor was especially covered.
This made her spitting problem as a newborn seem trivial.

I frantically ran her over to the bathtub so that we could 
contain the mess. I had to unload all of our dirty running 
clothes out of the bathtub with her in tow but managed. After 
I put her in the tub (no water), she was generally happy. I 
got her cleaned up a bit and actually took her back out so 
that I could clean things up. Taht worked well. After cleaning 
up, I put her in the bath for a long time and she had fun as 
usual. She got into a sleeper, and I did notice that as I was 
killing some time for her to go to bed, she spit up again 
(mostly watery this time). Thinking about to her younger days, 
I just stood with her on my shoulder and patted her back to 
hopefully get something out of necessary before she went to 
bed. Nothing ever came out and she fell asleep on my shoulder. 
I laid her down in her crib.

I was working on cleaning up further when I heard her start 
crying in her room. She wakes up soon after going to bed 
sometimes and usually that just means she needs a binky. 
However, I knew that wasn't the case tonight. I went in to 
find a huge pile of puke and more running down the front of 
her sleeper. Poor little girl. I tried to grab the pool of 
puke with a burp cloth and then stripped her down to start 
the cleaning process. Needing to put her somewhere while I 
got her situated, I just sat her on the ground in her diaper. 
I was trying to calm her down and figure out what to do next. 
She was exhaused. At a point, I was rubbing her back and she 
laid her head down on my foot and started to fall asleep. So 
I put her in a new sleeper, laid a blanket out on the floor 
with the hope that she would throw up on that rather than 
the floor if she needed to again, and she passed out 
immediately.

I got to work with cleaning up stuff and luckily Grace got 
home. We worked to get her pack'n'plat set up (the mattress 
cover in her crib was in serious need of the washer) and 
covered the pad with plastic so that if she did spit again 
only the sheet would be gone. Grace moved Gwen off of the 
floor and pretty much instantly she spit up some. Another 
new sheet. This time she sat up with Grace for a while, 
fell alseep again with her and then laid down fine after 
that. She only woke up 1 more time and at that point she 
actually did just need a binky.

A bit crazy for a Saturday night, but all is good. It's ironic 
that I was touting this weekend as a weekend we had nothing 
to do for the first time in over a month.
