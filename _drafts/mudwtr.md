My mother in-law got me Mudwtr for Christmas
2023. Prior to recieving it, I had never
heard of the product. In essence, Mudwtr is a
blend of mushrooms that is marketed
as a coffee replacement. It promises 
no caffiene jitters (due to a fraction of 
the caffiene of a cup of coffee) while 
helping you accomplish the same energy boost
of a cup of coffee.
