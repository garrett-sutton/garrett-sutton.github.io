My mother in-law got me Mudwtr for Christmas
2023. Prior to recieving it, I had never
heard of the product. In essence, Mudwtr is a
blend of mushrooms that is marketed
as a coffee replacement. It promises 
no caffiene jitters (due to a fraction of 
the caffiene of a cup of coffee) while 
helping you accomplish the same energy boost
of a cup of coffee.

## Taste test
<todo>Describe the taste. What is it like? </todo>
Full disclosure - I'm particularly poor at 
describing taste. When someone asks me what I think
of a particular food, I can usually let them know
if the thing was good or bad. After that, I'm 
useless.

For Mudwtr, I probably end up somewhere in the
middle of good and bad from a taste perspective. 
I still liked the taste 
of coffee better, but I definitely wouldn't call it
bad. I was also given cococunt milk and cocunut sugar
with the actual Mudwtr powder. On occassion, I 
mixed them in too. They would definitely give
it a different taste. Mudwtr says that
if you froth the coconut milk and mix with the 
Mudwtr powder, it should resemble a Chai tea latte.
I can sort of see this and would generalize that
it felt like Mudwtr was more like tea than like
coffee. 

The most noticeable thing from a taste/mouthfeel 
standpoint is that the powder doesn't actually
dissolve. According to Mudwtr, this is an indication
that they don't have some added chemicals in the
powder. For the consumer, it tastes like a lot of 
silt if you don't drink the Mudwtr fast enough. I 
found that I had to go back and partially refill
my mug several times in order to finish a cup 
without drinking silt as part of the bottom of the
cup. I am under the impression that just stirring
the powder enough suspends it in the water and once
it sits for a given amount of time, the powder just
falls to the bottom of the cup.
