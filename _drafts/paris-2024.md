As part of sabbatical 2024, we went from the Alps
to Paris on the first day of the Olympics. We 
didn't attend the opening ceremony, but watched
on French TV from our hotel room after we got 
Gwen to sleep.

## what did we do?
We stayed in the 6th arrondisment while we were in 
Paris. This area is sort of central Paris on the 
Southern side of the Siene River. It was a nice jumping
off point to see a lot of the major sites. As mentioned
above, we got in on a Friday and we stayed in Paris 
until Monday morning when we headed off for Normandy. 

### Saturday
I think this was the only day of the entire trip that it
rained, and it also may have been the longest day that we
were out for the whole trip. We set off from our hotel
bought a few umbrellas from the grocery store and stopped 
at a cafe get breakfast and coffee. This was unique compared
to other cafe's that we had found on the trip. Most others
would only have pastries, but this one had a bunch of 
different breakfast sandwiches and beautiful pastries. It
was a welcoming feeling to get away from the standard French
breakfast - coffee and a cigarette. 

Upon finishing breakfast, we made our way toward 
the Chapel of our Lady of the Miraculous Medal. At this chapel
in the heart of Paris, the Virgin Mary appeared to Saint 
Catherine Laboure - whose body rests incorrupt in this very
chapel. We stopped by the gift shop and then went into
the end of the daily mass to the few things we bought to be
blessed. The chapel itself was beautiful and it was
enlightening to read Saint Catherine Laboure's story. Fun fact.
Based on what I read, the Virgin Mary's apparition to Saint 
Catherine Laboure established the foundation of the Dogma of
the Immaculate Conception.  

I'd like to call out what I percieve to be a little bit of 
God's work around our visit to the chapel. Prior to getting
to the chapel, we had been walking for a
while and Grace was in serious need of a bathroom. In France,
there are public toilets along some streets. These things 
function sort of automatically. You press a button for the 
door to open, go in and the door closes behind you and then
you press a button to leave. For Grace though, the 
one bathroom we found kept opening the door every time she
went in. Fortunately for us, a nice woman walking by told us
about a nearby store that had a public bathroom. We found the
bathroom and made it over to the chapel, nothing too crazy.
However, after mass ended the same nice woman that helped us
in the street came strolling out of daily mass. She checked 
in to make sure we found the bathroom and then continued on. 
This is maybe just a strange coincidence, but it begs you to
see a His goodness as well. We hardly interacted with anyone
while we were on the trip. Then we see a stranger who went
out of her way to help us on the street again at mass in a 
very holy place. At the very least, He works in mysterious
ways.

After leaving the chapel, we wandered for a while. In our
meandering we walked through the Louvre gardens, came across
a few coffee shops, the River Siene, and La Concord at the east
end of the Champs Elyssees (the typical end of the Tour de
France). Rain continued on and off through the day, but our
umbrellas and few stops worked really well. Gwen slept peacefully
in the carrier as needed and we enjoyed the sights along the way.

As the day wore on, we did need to find a quiet place for Gwen
to eat. We were also looking for a place along the route for the
Olympic Time Trial in order to eat and watch some of the riders
pass by. Ultimately, we determined that the restaurants were
probably a bit too busy for Gwen to eat and we ended up coming
across a massive church - the Basillica of Saint Clotilde. It was
empty and we figured that if anywhere was going to be sympatheic
of a baby feeding, it should be in the Catholic Church. After 
Gwen ate, we found a perfect restaurant along the route and 
popped a squat. The cafe scene in Paris is truly incredible. To
be able to sit outside, on a sidewalk of a busy street and
take it in is something I'm just not used to. We watched Remco
win the time trial, asked for the bill and then made the 20 
minute walk back to our hotel. What a truly nice day.

### Sunday

Sunday was an absolutely goregous day. Cool temps, partly
cloudy skies, and no more rain!
We started our day with mass at Saint Sulpice. This church was 
enormous. It was so big that the main church wasn't actually
used for mass. There was a chapel behind the main alter where
mass was held. As with many of the churches that we saw in 
France, the level of detail at this scale and age is hard
to imagine. For a small mass that I didn't understand, it was
beautiful too. They sang gregorian chants, and I could 
understand a few points of that because it was in Latin
rather than French. I largely don't understand the Latin, but
it is at least a familiar sound. I would like to get better
at this though.

After mass, we went to a streetside cafe for breakfast (Le Pre). This was
one of the most American-like spots we stopped at during the whole
trip. I say that partially because it was more food that the cigarette 
and coffee that typically fills a Frechman's stomach for breakfast. 
They even had eggs and toast. This was by far the biggest meal we found for 
breakfast while out, and it was a really nice to start to fuel up for 
the day. Gwen (Grace and I too) had a grand time people watching out
into the Paris street from the table. The cafe was also not very busy,
which was nice for us as our blast radius (Gwen and our stuff) was 
pretty large amongst the close tables. 

After breakfast, we walked to Notre Dame. Unfortunately, it still 
wasn't open to the public, but even walking around outside was 
pretty cool. The external of the church is also beautiful. And 
on the north side of the church, they had a series of visuals
depicting the restoration process. At Notre Dame, we had our first
real public bathroom dilema. we'd heard that in France it's not 
common to have public bathrooms and in the places that do
have them, you have to pay for them. With this in our minds but
also a need to pee, we went ot these public restrooms below 
Notre Dame. It cost 2.50 euro per person and they almost also
charged us for Gwen as well. That felt steep, but complaining
about it wasn't going to change it. It got commically weird
when the turnstiles to let people in seemingly didn't work and
there were these 2 guys that had to use a card reader to 
let you in. The comical part was that none of this was clear
and I don't recall these guys saying a word to anyone as people
were trying to figure it out. Fortunately for us, we were able 
to go to the bathroom, Gwen could get changed, and we were
able to move along quickly enough.

From Notre Dame, we hopped
a subway to the Eiffel Tower. I will admit, I wasnt' all that
excited to see the Eiffel Tower, largely becase I assumed it 
wasn't all that large. However; I couldn't have been more wrong. It
was a lot bigger than I expected. We spent some time at a 
good vantage point to get pictures before going into our
main event for the day - 
Olympic Beach Volleyball under the Eiffel Tower. 

Both Grace and I weren't sure how putting Gwen in a stadium for
3 hours would go. But this stadium turned out to be as good of 
a situation as we could ahve asked for. First, there is a large 
park that sits under the Eiffel Tower. The acutal stadium was 
built at the far end of htat park. But rather than the typical 
sports venue where your ticket gets you into the stadium, our
tickets got us into the park and by extension the stadium. This
made for a really nice experience. On several occasions, Grace 
was able to take Gwen out into the park to play a bit. They also
had an area with misters where you could cool off. It wasn't 
all that hot for us (the cloud cover was perfect), but Gwen 
really loved going through the mist. Inside the stadium was 
probably one of the most cool sporting events I've seen in person.
There's something really fun about football and baseball games
in the US, but this was different. The Olympics organizers did
a fantasic job of setting this whole thing up. It was seriously
enjoyable - low stress, a great atmosphere, and incredible 
vantage point of the Eiffel Tower.

## feelings on Paris

I should start by saying that most people I talked to about
Paris that had been said things like, "overrated", 
"underwhelming", or "should have stayed there for less time."
I clung to at least some of this sentiment, but
I was also hopeful that our 2 days in Paris wouldn't be so
long that I started to wish time away. In hindsight, it 
never got to that point though. I can honestly say that I
didn't share the same sentiment that was shared with me. 
Paris was an awesome place for us to visit for a few days. 
The age combined with level of detail makes walking around
through the streets an awe inspiring experience in an of
itself. I really enjoyed looking at all of the historical 
landmarks and appreciating how much work it must have been
to build and how much work it continues to be to maintain.

By the time we arrived in Paris, we had been on the road for
just over a week. And as I've mentioned in others posts, we
had a bit of a hard time at points fitting into French culture.
Meals were different. Business hours were different. The 
language was obviously different. But when we got to Paris,
things changed a little bit. It was apparent early on that
there was a lot of American influence throughout Paris. That's
not supposed to be a totally snobby American comment, but 
rather a testament to the fact that Paris is an international
city. They have all different types of food. They're open for
business to accomodate the many tourists. And you start to hear
English a little bit more (that is likely more due to their
British neighbors visiting). In short, I felt less out of 
place in Paris than I did at any other point in the trip. 
I felt like we were able to see things as they were and not
have to worry about underlying cultural expectations that may
just be different from the US and France. 

Moving on, transitioning during all phases of
our trip was difficult. We effectively had our entire lives
on our backs or in Gwen's stroller. And the stroller was 
particularly challenging. There were many places in Paris 
that lacked elevators and escalators - namely the subways. 
This could be pretty stressful when we ran 
into these situations and it made em appreciate all of the ADA
things that exist in the US. Though it was stressful to think
about what accessibility challenges we might encounter, many
Parisians' were extraordinatily helpful along the way. Random
strangers helped us carry the stroller up/down stairs multiple
times and talked through intercom systems to open handicap
accessible exits. We really appreciated it. It was nice to 
feel like we weren't entirely on our own in this big 
foreign world. God puts good people everywhere.

On a differnt note, I'll also call attention to the police
presence in Paris. There were generally police everywhere that
we went, but I noticed it acutely in Paris. This makes sense.
The Olympics are one of the biggest events in the world and 
consequently a target for bad people to do bad things. The 
interesting part of this to me was the fact that seemingly
the French military was on patrol through the streets of Paris
with assault weapons. I've never seen such a thing before in 
the US. Though meant to exude a posture of safety, I honestly 
felt more uneasy than I do when I go to a big event in the US
and don't see this presencef. My speculative feeling here is certainly
a level of confidence in US intelligence over others, but it also
feels like a hope and a prayer to have soldiers on foot patrol.
I don't know anything about intelligence or maintaining public 
safety for that matter, but I largely call this out to highlight
what feels like an obvious difference in appraoch to public
safety between France and the US. For what it's worth, I never
had any reason to actually feel unsafe while we were in Paris.
