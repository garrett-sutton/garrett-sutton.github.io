As part of sabbatical 2024, we went from the Alps
to Paris on the first day of the Olympics. We 
didn't attend the opening ceremony, but watched
on French TV from our hotel room after we got 
Gwen to sleep.

## what did we do?
We stayed in the 6th arrondisment while we were in 
Paris. This area is sort of central Paris on the 
Southern side of the Siene River. It was a nice jumping
off point to see a lot of the major sites. As mentioned
above, we got in on a Friday and we stayed in Paris 
until Monday morning when we headed off for Normandy. 

### Saturday
I think this was the only day of the entire trip that it
rained, and it also may have been the longest day that we
were out for the whole trip. Our goals for today were:
- Miraculous Medal Chapel
- the Louvre area
- 


I'm not sure it makes sense to set "goals" for today. 
Generally speaking we just sort of wandered. I can 
highlgiht were we started wandering to and then go
from there.

### Sunday
