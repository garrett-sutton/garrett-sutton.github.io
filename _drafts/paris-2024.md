As part of sabbatical 2024, we went from the Alps
to Paris on the first day of the Olympics. We 
didn't attend the opening ceremony, but watched
on French TV from our hotel room after we got 
Gwen to sleep.

## what did we do?
We stayed in the 6th arrondisment while we were in 
Paris. This area is sort of central Paris on the 
Southern side of the Siene River. It was a nice jumping
off point to see a lot of the major sites. As mentioned
above, we got in on a Friday and we stayed in Paris 
until Monday morning when we headed off for Normandy. 

### Saturday
I think this was the only day of the entire trip that it
rained, and it also may have been the longest day that we
were out for the whole trip. We set off from our hotel
bought a few umbrellas from the grocery store and stopped 
at a cafe get breakfast and coffee. This was unique compared
to other cafe's that we had found on the trip. Most others
would only have pastries, but this one had a bunch of 
different breakfast sandwiches and beautiful pastries. It
was a welcoming feeling to get away from the standard French
breakfast - coffee and a cigarette. 

Upon finishing breakfast, we made our way toward 
the Chapel of our Lady of the Miraculous Medal. At this chapel
in the heart of Paris, the Virgin Mary appeared to Saint 
Catherine Laboure - whose body rests incorrupt in this very
chapel. We stopped by the gift shop and then went into
the end of the daily mass to the few things we bought to be
blessed. The chapel itself was beautiful and it was
enlightening to read Saint Catherine Laboure's story. 

I'd like to call out what I percieve to be a little bit of 
God's work around our visit to the chapel. Prior to getting
to the chapel, we had been walking for a
while and Grace was in serious need of a bathroom. In France,
there are public toilets along some streets. These things 
function sort of automatically. You press a button for the 
door to open, go in and the door closes behind you and then
you press a button to leave. For Grace though, the 
one bathroom we found kept opening the door every time she
went in. Fortunately for us, a nice woman walking by told us
about a nearby store that had a public bathroom. We found the
bathroom and made it over to the chapel, nothing too crazy.
However, after mass ended the same nice woman that helped us
in the street came strolling out of daily mass. She checked 
in to make sure we found the bathroom and then continued on. 
This is maybe just a strange coincidence, but it begs you to
see a His goodness as well. We hardly interacted with anyone
while we were on the trip. Then we see a stranger who went
out of her way to help us on the street again at mass in a 
very holy place. At the very least, He works in mysterious
ways.

After leaving the chapel, we wandered for a while. In our
meandering we walked through the Louvre gardens, came across
a few coffee shops, the River Siene, and La Concord at the east
end of the Champs Elyssees (the typical end of the Tour de
France). Rain continued on and off through the day, but our
umbrellas and few stops worked really well. Gwen slept peacefully
in the carrier as needed and we enjoyed the sights along the way.

As the day wore on, we did need to find a quiet place for Gwen
to eat. We were also looking for a place along the route for the
Olympic Time Trial in order to eat and watch some of the riders
pass by. Ultimately, we determined that the restaurants were
probably a bit too busy for Gwen to eat and we ended up coming
across a massive church - the Basillica of Saint Clotilde. It was
empty and we figured that if anywhere was going to be sympatheic
of a baby feeding, it should be in the Catholic Church. After 
Gwen ate, we found a perfect restaurant along the route and 
popped a squat. The cafe scene in Paris is truly incredible. To
be able to sit outside, on a sidewalk of a busy street and
take it in is something I'm just not used to. We watched Remco
win the time trial, asked for the bill and then made the 20 
minute walk back to our hotel. What a truly nice day.

### Sunday

On Sunday, we went to mass at Saint Sulpice. This church was 
enormous. It was so big that the main church wasn't actually
used for mass. There was a chapel behind the main alter where
mass was held. As with many of the churches that we saw in 
France, the level of detail at this scale and age is hard
to imagine. For a small mass that I didn't understand, it was
beautiful too. They sang gregorian chants, and I could 
understand a few points of that because it was in Latin
rather than French. I largely don't understand the Latin, but
it is at least a familiar sound. I would like to get better
at this though.

After mass, we went to a streetside cafe for breakfast. This was
one of the most American-like spots we stopped at during the whole
trip.
