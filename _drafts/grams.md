## how it came about
I mentioned in a previous post about Easter 2024
that we saw both sets of Gwen's grandparents
on our trip to PA and MD. So it might also 
come as a suprise that my mother-in-law
brought up the idea of coming to visit us the day after
we got back. And she was going to bring my
mom along with her. They were planning on coming
at the end of April (three weeks later).

I feel like this is the exact scenario that
everyone talks about with grandparents - 
showing up basically unannounced in an effort to
see grand babies. Because we're 10+ hours away
from either of our families, we likely get a few
weeks of buffer rather than no notice at all. 
In any case, there's got to be a really good
reason to say no. And in this scenario, we had no 
excuses. I should also call out that I am by no 
means saying that I was against my mom and 
mother-in-law coming to visit. It's always nice
to have people come to visit. And with more hands
in the house -- espeically Grandma hands -- to help
with Gwen, Grace and I's lives get a bit easier too.

Outside of the context of this situation, there 
is still a bit of trepedation around your parents
and their influence on your children. Even though
Grace and I feel that we have good relationships
with our parents today and that we were raised in
loving environments, there are inevitably going
to be things that we do in 2024 that are just different
from what our parents did in the early 2000s. That 
doesn't mean it's an indictment on our parents. It
is simply that we are planning to do things in a 
different way. The feeling of control and influence
may honestly be exacerbated by the fact that our 
families live so far away. For 99% of our time, we
live in a reality were we can do things as we see
fit without pressure from our parents' influence.
So when they do come to visit every so often, there is
an inevitable fear that they can exert some 
sort of influence over Gwen. In other words, this is 
a situation we just aren't used to and it feels like
there are unknown unknowns.

Interestingly, this feeling of grandparents asserting
some sort of control over our child was brought
front of mind with none other than my Grandma. The 
motives behind why my Grandma brought this up while
we were on the phone is another subject entirely, but
as we were talking, she said something along the lines of
She is your kid (referring to Gwen) and you need to 
put your foot down with her Grand mothers if you see 
fit. I sort of laughed this off at the time, but it 
does continue to ring in my head a bit. I think by the 
nature of the relationship between grandparents, parents,
and children, there is likely to always be at least
a bit of a tension in how grandparents and parents seek
to influence children. 

## the week 
The grams arrived just after Gwen went to sleep on 
Tuesday night. Since both of them had already 
spent some time here in the last few months, there
was little debreifing needed for the coming days. 
And things seemed to go pretty well for them during the
day. They even made a trip to visit me for lunch one day.

They were having such a good week that when I left for
work on Friday morning and Grace wished me a happy
Friday, my mom was awestruck. She was fully convinced
that it was only Thursday. It's not often someone is
lamenting the fact that it's Friday. 
Also on Friday, Grace took a half of a day 
and they ventured out to the Chazen Art Museum for a 
full cultural experience.

With the additional help, Grace and I were able to 
have a nice evening out for our 3rd wedding anniversary.
We do get a decent amount of time to
spend together in the evening after Gwen goes to bed. 
However, it's refreshing to step out of that routine 
and know that Gwen is in good hands.

Saturday was goregous outside and it was the perfect time  
to head down to the Arboreteum to see some of the trees
blossoming. Grace and I got a nice run in while Gwen 
meandered through the trees with her grams, eventually
finding a nice spot to play under a beautiful magnolia
tree.  

<TODO: add picture of Gwen under the trees>

We kept with the standard GS Saturday routine and hit up
a coffee shop on the way home. 

My mother-in-law has been raving about playing disc 
golf recnetly, and brought along her discs. Neither Grace, nor
my mom, nor I had ever played before, so we went
to the disc golf course nearby to try it out. Like I mentioned 
before, Grace and I's lives do get a bit easier when we have 
soem visitors that help with Gwen. In this instance, I was able
to ride my bike over the course and not feel like I was leaving
Grace hanging. It really is the little things. As for disc golf, 
I wasn't very good. I don't think I've every been great at 
throwing a frisbee, so this experience simply reaffirmed that. 
It was fun to play though. It was nice to be outside and have
a low stakes activity to keep us preocuppied with. 
All while we played frisbee, Grace managed to get Gwen to sleep 
in the jogging stroller, so we were nicely able to push her along 
the course and keep playing. 

After making it back from disc golf, we all got ourselves together
and made it to 5 pm mass at Queen of Peace. This was some new
territory for Grace and I as parents. Typically we are trying to
get Gwen to sleep through mass because it's at 8:30 - usually 
a well suited for her to sleep. On the other hand,
there isn't probably a much worse time for her to sleep than at or
after 5 pm. So we had Gwen out of her seat for most of mass. She 
happily bounced with me, sat between Grace and I in the pew, and 
gauked at all of the people around us.

Gram and Grammy were on their way
the next morning. They seemed to have had a really nice week
with Gwen. Gwen sure loved the attention. And Grace and I 
enjoyed the company and a bit of a repreive.
