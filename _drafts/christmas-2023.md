# Christmas 2023

## Traveling with a 3-month old is crazy right?
Gwen was born October 3. And before we could
get acclimated to all of the change associated
with being parents, we were considering traveling
to Grace's family for Christmas. Time was of the 
essence; otherwise, we run the risk of getting
priced out of the trip all together. 

I was admittedly apprehensive for a few reasons:
- Safety of traveling with a 3-month old
- Logistics of traveling with a 3-month old
- Cost of the trip
- My own desire to stay home for the holidays

Quickly, we worked through each concern.
- We discussed with the pediatrician about
how safe it would be to travel with Gwen being
so little. She would have be first round of shots
by this point, so that would help her out. But
it doesn't eliminate risk entirely. We had to be
OK with a non-zero level of risk if we were to 
travel. Our pediatrician also recommended - for 
Gwen's sake as well as ours - that we consider
getting a seat for Gwen. Though she could technically
be labeled as a lap-infant, it safer for her to
have her car seat.
- Traveling with an infant is surprisingly possible.
After a few quick google searches, there are 
a variety of accomodations that airlines and airports
provide for families traveling with small children. 
I'll talk more through this below. It's also nice
from a logistics standpoint that we can fly direct 
from Madison or Milwaukee to NYC. This was probably
the least resolvable concern. It would take the 
experience to feel "comfortable" here. 
- On first look at flights, we found that we could
fly directly from Milwaukee to NYC on a cheap ticket. 
- Grace presented the case that it would be really
nice to introduce Gwen to everyone back home during 
this time. For the first year in several, Grace's
sister (a nurse) was also off work on Christmas. 
Social engagement would be good for us. It would 
also be nice for us to have some additional help with
Gwen. Maybe we'd even get to relax a little bit.

## Confirmed it is crazy, but we're doing it anyway
With enough concerns resolved, we booked our
flight to New York at the end of October. We were
set to leave from Milwaukee on December 23 and 
return Friday December 29.

Then we encountered an additional wrinkle in our plans
2 weeks after booking our flights. My friend Dan
was getting married on December 30 in Georgia! Luckily -
for a nice additional charge - we could keep the
whole family together and change our
return flight on December 29 from JFK->MKE to JFK->ATL.
Then we booked a one-way flight from ATL->MKE on 
December 31.

### Packing
Packing is one of my least favorite things. I typically
stall for as long as possible, pack way too many things
and then feel embarassed that I packed too many things.
Typically, I'll end up in a state where I still have 
too many things, but it's less than I originally packed, 
so I feel a little bit better about it. I suspect my 
problem is that I want to be efficient, but 
fear what happens if any XYZ scenario happens (bad 
weather, going out vs hanging out, Gwen spitting on
me).

While I was stressing over my own packing, Grace was 
busy putting together her and Gwen's bags. She bought
a shoe rack that hangs on the back of a door and stuffed
all of Gwen's stuff into it. We could roll this up and 
put it in a bag. Then we could stay organized on our travels by having it hang on the back of our door.

#### Bag total:
1. Garrett carry-on
1. Garretty backpack (personal item)
1. Grace carry-on
1. Grace handback (personal item)
1. Grace breast pump bag (labeled as assistive device)
1. Gwen diaper bag (labeled as assisteive device)
1. Gwen checked bag
1. Gwen stroller (gets gate checked)
1. Gwen car seat (used in her plane seat)

In our initial planning we intended to only have a carry 
on for Gwen, but after how big the bag ended up we 
checked it. Thank goodness for that because I'm not sure 
how we would have gotten it all in the plane. It's not 
so bad in the airport because you can stuff things in 
the bottom of the stroller.
