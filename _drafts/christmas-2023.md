# Christmas 2023

## Traveling with a 3-month old is crazy right?
Gwen was born October 3. And before we could
get acclimated to all of the change associated
with being parents, we were considering traveling
to Grace's family for Christmas. Time was of the 
essence; otherwise, we run the risk of getting
priced out of the trip all together. 

I was admittedly apprehensive for a few reasons:
- Safety of traveling with a 3-month old
- Logistics of traveling with a 3-month old
- Cost of the trip
- My own desire to stay home for the holidays

Quickly, we worked through each concern.
- We discussed with the pediatrician about
how safe it would be to travel with Gwen being
so little. She would have be first round of shots
by this point, so that would help her out. But
it doesn't eliminate risk entirely. We had to be
OK with a non-zero level of risk if we were to 
travel. Our pediatrician also recommended - for 
Gwen's sake as well as ours - that we consider
getting a seat for Gwen. Though she could technically
be labeled as a lap-infant, it safer for her to
have her car seat.
- Traveling with an infant is surprisingly possible.
After a few quick google searches, there are 
a variety of accomodations that airlines and airports
provide for families traveling with small children. 
I'll talk more through this below. It's also nice
from a logistics standpoint that we can fly direct 
from Madison or Milwaukee to NYC. This was probably
the least resolvable concern. It would take the 
experience to feel "comfortable" here. 
- On first look at flights, we found that we could
fly directly from Milwaukee to NYC on a cheap ticket. 
- Grace presented the case that it would be really
nice to introduce Gwen to everyone back home during 
this time. For the first year in several, Grace's
sister (a nurse) was also off work on Christmas. 
Social engagement would be good for us. It would 
also be nice for us to have some additional help with
Gwen. Maybe we'd even get to relax a little bit.

## Confirmed: it is crazy, but we're doing it anyway
With enough concerns resolved, we booked our
flight to New York at the end of October. We were
set to leave from Milwaukee on December 23 and 
return Friday December 29.

Then we encountered an additional wrinkle in our plans
2 weeks after booking our flights. My friend Dan
was getting married on December 30 in Georgia! Luckily -
for a nice additional charge - we could keep the
whole family together and change our
return flight on December 29 from JFK->MKE to JFK->ATL.
Then we booked a one-way flight from ATL->MKE on 
December 31.

### Packing
Packing is one of my least favorite things. I typically
stall for as long as possible, pack way too many things
and then feel embarassed that I packed too many things.
Typically, I'll end up in a state where I still have 
too many things, but it's less than I originally packed, 
so I feel a little bit better about it. I suspect my 
problem is that I want to be efficient, but 
fear what happens if any XYZ scenario happens (bad 
weather, going out vs hanging out, Gwen spitting on
me).

While I was stressing over my own packing, Grace was 
busy putting together her and Gwen's bags. She bought
a shoe rack that hangs on the back of a door and stuffed
all of Gwen's stuff into it. We could roll this up and 
put it in a bag. Then we could stay organized on our 
travels by having it hang on the back of our door.

#### Bag total:
1. Garrett carry-on
1. Garretty backpack (personal item)
1. Grace carry-on
1. Grace handback (personal item)
1. Grace breast pump bag (labeled as assistive device)
1. Gwen diaper bag (labeled as assisteive device)
1. Gwen checked bag
1. Gwen stroller (gets gate checked)
1. Gwen car seat (used in her plane seat)

In our initial planning we intended to only have a carry 
on for Gwen, but after how big the bag ended up we 
checked it. Thank goodness for that because I'm not sure 
how we would have gotten it all in the plane. It's not 
so bad in the airport because you can stuff things in 
the bottom of the stroller. It's a whole new ballgame 
when you enter the plane though. 
The "if you have strollers, please board with
group 1" instruction doesn't necessarily serve you. Airlines
make it out this way, but in reality, they know you take 
longer to get on the plane. I feel that they just do this
to give you a slight head-start. In all
of our flights, the other groups to board were passing us
on the jet bridge as we figured ourselves out. It felt
like there is an art to unloading the stroller, 
keeping track of a baby, and trying to figure out how to 
carry all of this
stuff with 4 hands while people are going past you 
becasue they think the plane might leave them on the jet 
bridge. 

### Traveling
#### Arriving like it's an international flight
I'll start by saying I am neurotic about being early for 
flights. Put simply, I'd rather wait in the airport 
than wait for another plane. I'm generally anxious about 
travel, and I find relief 
when I know we can no longer miss our flight. Combine 
this with an infant who needs to eat at a consistent
schedule and unknown unknowns about getting her through 
the airport and we were showing up at least 3 hours
before each flight.

#### Trying to keep Gwen from getting hangry
Feeding was particularly stressful. It's difficult to 
keep Gwen on pace to get to 8 feeds a day in a 
controlled environment at home. It felt evermore 
difficult during traveling due to the need 
to operate on public-transportation
time and the sparing number of places to feed. We were
pretty much forced to accept the fact that 8 feeds
while traveling might be impossible. Finding places to
feed varied from sitting in the boarding area, to on
the floor outside of security, to on the floor next
to a baggage claim (that later turned on), to on the 
plane, to lactation pods in the airport, to in 
restaurants after we left the airport. By the end of our
week, Gwen was having a particularly hard time eating in 
general. Couple that with the abnormal and probably
uncomfortable feeeding situation and she's really having
a rough time. Luckily, by the time
we made it back home, Gwen got back into a good 
rhythm of feeding.

#### Still have to take off your shoes - even with an infant
Security is a stressful process for everyone, and it
can be even more stressful with an infant. You
have to do all of the normal things and then
handle baby things. All of the normal things means
that all 9 of the bags I mentioned above have
to make it through the scanner (aside from the 
stroller), your pockets must be empty, and you need
to take your shoes off. And since the car seat 
has to go through the scanner, baby Gwen also had to 
come out. The stroller just gets hand checked by TSA. 
As long as we were patient, I felt like this didn't 
go all that bad. It just takes time. From our 
experience, some airports are more accomodating than
others with respect to traveling with small children.
In MKE and ATL (keep in mind ATL is one of the busiest
airports in the USA), we used a dedicated lane for 
strollers to get through security. It was nice. The
TSA agents were really nice and helpful to us regarding 
what we needed to do. At JFK, we were packed into the 
security line like sardines with no special 
accomodations. This was admittedly frustrating given 
we'd had a taste of accomodation back in MKE, but it's
not entirely surprising for NYC. We made it through 
though with only a few small outbursts from Gwen while 
we waited in line. 

#### By air
Flying was less stressful than I thought it would be.
When sitting next to an infant on a plane, you have this 
fear they'll cry the entire flight. As a parent, I share
that exact same fear. Gwen cried at least a little on
each of our flights. However, it didn't feel nearly
as bad as I expected it to be. I certainly wasn't 
looking around to see who was looking at us, but I 
think the noise of the plane muffled her noise a lot.
It's worth noting that our dream was for Gwen to sleep
through all of these flights. A lesson in parenting -
have no expectations for actually adhering to your plans.
On our first flight, she slept for the first 
half, woke up with her first blowout ever, and ate 
during the descent. Even with poop running down her
leg and on her car seat, we managed to keep it together. 
The airplane bathrooms are certainly sketchy to change a 
baby, but also not the end of the world.

Here is a cute picture of Gwen as we're about to take 
off from JFK. If you look really closely, you can see  
the Manhattan skyline off in the distance!

#### By land
I'll also breifly call out that the driving we did
during this trip added complexity. It is a 90 minute 
drive from 
Madison to Milwaukee, a 2 hour drive from JFK to 
Pawling, and 
a 3 hour drive from ATL to the wedding location. With 
each leg of the journey, Gwen broke her car trip length 
record.
For the car travel to/from the wedding, we had to stop 
along the way
at a Truett's Grill (a sit down Chick-fil-A, whaa?) and 
McDonalds for feeding. Grace was able to sit and nurse
in a booth with no problem. 

### Time Spent with family and friends
It doesn't feel like there is a point to travel just
for the sake of travel. It's the people and activities
that come along the way that really make it worth it.

#### NY
It was really nice to be with Grace's family
for the better part of a week. Though I'd be hard
pressed to say Pawling is rural NY (it's common
for people to ride a train to NYC for work), it 
can really feel like we are way out there. Grace's 
parents live in an older farm house on top of a hill
with a big fireplace that is always ablaze. There is 
virtually no cell service (they do have good wifi), so I 
tend to put my phone
on airplane mode unless we go into town.

It's nice to get away from work, the constant stream of 
phone content, the normal routine of 
day-to-day life at home. Instead, I was able to run in 
the middle of the day, hang out with a book in hand, and 
have good conversations with whoever was around. Grace 
and I were able to do
our first run together in months because someone was at
the house to take care of Gwen for a little bit.
