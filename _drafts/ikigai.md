Ikigai was given to me out of the blue by 
a friend and I admittedly had no clue what to
expect when I started it. Turns out, this 
was a really good, engaging, and impactful 
read.

## Summary
There are a few exemplary communities 
in our world that have strikingly high numbers 
of very old people. These communities are
known as the Blue Zones. 
Ikigai seeks to explore the people of the
Japanese island of Okinawa, one of those Blue
Zones, and provide insights to readers on how
you also may live a long and happy life.  

## My takeaways
Ikigai goes through several factors that it attributes
to the longevity of the people of Okinawa. I found the 
following points to be the most compelling. 

### limiting stress
I recall learning about the negative effects of high-stress
on our health back in high school. Additionally, stress can 
take your
attention away from the things that matter to 
you. I've certainly let stress get the best of me at different
point over the last several years - even becoming almost 
paralyzed by some stress and letting a nice moment slip by. 
This portion of the book was a good reminder to 
have faith that God will take care of me in the hard
times and that all that I can do is all I can do. 

### having a positive outlook on life
It's the beginning of election season as I am writing this 
and there's a pretty consistent message of doom and gloom
around the USA. I feel like I can see that messaging
infiltrate people - including myself. The book generally
encourages a positive outlook for the sake of 
your happiness. Similar to what I said about stress 
- that I've let moments slip by - it feels like
having a generally positive attitude helps us
live in the moment and enjoy life more. I think that
our attitude toward a situation likely has a heavy 
influence on the situation.

### finding your ikigai
There is a nice diagram that describes your ikigai 
that I'd encourage you to look up to explain this 
concept. On the back cover of the book, it's simply
described as the thing that gets you out of bed in 
the morning. 

I found it interesting how this part of the book
wasn't encouraging people to simply follow their
passion like we often hear in our society. I took
It is more like seeking to understand yourself in
such a way that you can do something for
society that you love and are good at. Because of
the value added to society, it's easy to keep 
busy with the activity and because of your love
and aptitude, it's not too stressful.

### have friends and spend time with them consistently
Though maybe not emphasized as much as other 
pieces of the book, almost every story told in the
book involved people doing things with their friends.
This theme felt particularly important because
Grace and I currently live 10+ hours away from both
of our families. We've started to make more lasting
friends over the last year or so, but it feels
particularly important to lean into that more as 
we continue to live here. The age-old excuse of 
"we're just busy introverts that don't mind being alone" 
is not that great of an excuse. Especially with a
little one in the picture, building a community
is as important for us as it is for little Gwen.   

### eat well
I've been on a tirade over the past year-ish about 
eating healthier with a particular emphasis on 
limiting the amount of sugar that we consume. I'll
continue to contend that I am not anti-dessert. I'm
just anti-sugar that exists in all of the foods 
that you wouldn't even think have sugar in them. In 
reality, that's most of the processed food you buy
at the grocery store. 

The specific pieces the book attributes to a healthy
diet included:
   - lots of vegetables
   - lots of different types of food
   - limited amounts of sugar
   - eating only until you're 80% full

I've heard a similar point to advocating for only
eating until you're 80% full. In my elementary 
understanding, when we consistently overeat, we're
giving our body more than it needs. This 
leads to our body not utilizing the nutrients we give 
it in the most efficient way possible. 

### regular low-intensity exercise
The book highlights that the people in Okinawa
don't necessarily do a lot of very intentional 
exercise. But they are constantly working on their
garden or walking around their villages.

Given life in the US is much different than 
the island of Okinawa, I take from this
that it's ultra important to exercise regularly.
But also, we shouldn't overlook the value of just
moving during the day. I think that can look 
like just getting up regularly during the 
work day to walk around for a few minutes.
