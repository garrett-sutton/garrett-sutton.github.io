Ikigai was given to me out of the blue by 
a friend and I admittedly had no clue what to
expect when I started it. Turns out, this 
was a really good, engaging and impactful 
read.

## Summary
There are a few exemplary communities 
in our world that have strikingly high numbers 
of very old people. These communities are
known as the Blue Zones. 
Ikigai seeks to _explore_ the people of the
Japanese island of Okinawa, one of those Blue
Zones, and provide insights to readers on how
you also may live a long and happy life.  

Ikigai goes through several factors that it attributes
to the longevity of the people of Okinawa, including:
- limiting your stress
- finding your passion (your ikigai) and letting it
keep you busy in a meaningful but not too stressful
way
- have friends and spend time with them consistently
- eat well
   - lots of vegetables
   - limited amounts of sugar
   - eating only until you're 80% full
- regular low intensity exercise
