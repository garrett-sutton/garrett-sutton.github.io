Ikigai was given to me out of the blue by 
a friend and I admittedly had no clue what to
expect when I started it. Turns out, this 
was a really good, engaging and impactful 
read.

## Summary
There are a few exemplary communities 
in our world that have strikingly high numbers 
of very old people. These communities are
known as the Blue Zones. 
Ikigai seeks to explore the people of the
Japanese island of Okinawa, one of those Blue
Zones, and provide insights to readers on how
you also may live a long and happy life.  

Ikigai goes through several factors that it attributes
to the longevity of the people of Okinawa, including:
- limiting your stress
- finding your passion (your ikigai) and letting it
keep you busy in a meaningful but not too stressful
way
- have friends and spend time with them consistently
- eat well
   - lots of vegetables
   - limited amounts of sugar
   - eating only until you're 80% full
- regular low intensity exercise

## My takeaways
### limiting stress
I've been aware that stress is a known carcinogen.
Reading this section was enlightening to hear that 
importance again. I feel like this is an area for
me to improve on.

### friends
Though maybe not emphasized as much as other 
pieces of the book, almost every story told in the
book invlved people doing things with their friends.


### eating
I've been on a tirade for the better part of a year
now that we eat too much sugar.
