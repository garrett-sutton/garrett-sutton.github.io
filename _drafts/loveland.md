## The TLDR
We went to Loveland on the last day of our
4 day family/friend trip to Colorado in March 2023. 
I had previously been to Loveland in
March 2021 and left feeling like there was more
to be desired. A former local even described it
to me as a "niche" resort prior to our trip. This day, however, completely flipped the 
script for me. Loveland was a close second to my favorite day of the trip (behind an absolutely
dreamy day at Vail).  

### The would I go back?
Most definitely! Loveland isn't probably the place
I'd want to spend an entire trip at, but it is a 
ton of fun for a day or 2. It has a lot of great 
intermediate-to-expert level terrain that doesn't seem to get bumped out nearly as much as a lot of other places I've been to. Most of the mountain isn't overly steep, allowing you to be creative and play through the various areas - high alpine bowls, groomers or trees. 

I also value a resort that is down-to-earth. Loveland 
has one of the cheapest lift tickets that I've 
seen in all of skiing, lacks the fancy amenities of other big resorts. You can tell skiing is the priority here!
