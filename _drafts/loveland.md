## The TLDR
We went to Loveland on the last day of our
4 day family/friend trip to Colorado in March 2023. 
I had previously been to Loveland in
March 2021 and left feeling like there was more
to be desired. A former local even described it
to me as a "niche" resort prior to our trip. This day, 
however, completely flipped the 
script for me. Loveland was a close second to my 
favorite day of the trip (behind an absolutely
dreamy day at Vail).  

### The would I go back?
Most definitely! Loveland isn't probably the place
I'd want to spend an entire trip at, but it is a 
ton of fun for a day or 2. It has a lot of great 
intermediate-to-expert level terrain that doesn't seem 
to get bumped out nearly as much as a lot of other places 
I've been to. Most of the mountain isn't overly steep, 
allowing you to be creative and play through the 
various areas - high alpine bowls, groomers or trees. 

I also value a resort that is down-to-earth. Loveland 
has one of the cheapest lift tickets that I've 
seen in all of skiing, lacks the fancy amenities of 
other big resorts. You can tell skiing is the priority here!

### The snow
The snow at Loveland resembles all of the other Colorado 
ski resorts that I've been to. It seeminly dry and cold
due the high Colorado elevation. The wind is probably
always a factor here given it's placement just east of the
Continental Divide. This provides constant potential  
for big leeward snow deposits.

Likely in part due to the wind, areas lower on the mountain
(all that we really got to do on this trip) were well covered
and I don't recall any bare or really icy spots. Loveland 
markets themselves as the resort receiving the most snow
of any of the CO Front Range / Summit County resorts. In
both times I've been there, this seems like a fair claim.

### The mountain
On a map, Loveland looks like one really big bowl, made up
of several other small bowls and I70's Eisenhower tunnel 
in the middle. I feel that it can be split into the high 
alpine areas and below that. 

In the high alpine - especially
around lift 9, there's some really steep wide open bowl 
skiing. Areas serviced by the snowcat are all in the high
alpine and are all labeled as single black, double black or
expert level terrain. Other lifts like 4, 8, and Ptarmigan
also service high alpine areas but have easier ways down.

Below the high alpine, that is a variety of open groomers
and good tree skiing. The trees present a nice mix of close and 
steep with open and mellow. Much of this area is sort of
"create your own" while trying to get back to a lift.

I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the Chet's Dream lift too.
This is the only high-speed quad lift and leaves right from the
base area. It goes to the South of the base area where you 
can hit some pretty gnarly terrain to skiers right or traverse
to skiers left and pick from a variety of blues, blacks, and
trees. The latter option is especially a ton of fun because those
can be some really long runs and then you're rewarded with a
really short lift ride back to the top.

## The human element
Loveland gives off a ragtag family vibe. It has terrain 
for everyone, with an affordable lift ticket and food. 
The latter two are almost unheard of 
at a ski resort circa 2023. 
There's no on-site lodging, so people are showing up 
with their eyes set on skiing. 

### The Crowds
We went to Loveland on a very windy Sunday. A lot of lifts 
were put on wind holds and eventually closed for the day. 
I imagine this isn't an all too uncommon occurrence since 
Loveland is situated on the Continental Divide. All of this 
is to say that by the end of the day, there were no crowds 
at all. We consistently skied down and right onto the lift. 
Even in the morning when some lifts were put on hold, it 
didn't seem like that many people ended up all congregated 
in a certain area. 

I think the forecasted high winds and the fact that said 
winds ended up coming to fruition certainly played a role 
in the limited amount of people we encountered. Additionally, 
Loveland not being classified as a destination resort like 
some of its neighbors - Breck, Keystone, Copper, etc - has 
to be considered as a consistent crowd limiter.

### The Amenities
Loveland doesn't have much for amenities compared to other 
ski resorts. At the base area there is a ticket office, bar, 
cafeteria, and locker room.
It's reminds me of the place I grew up skiing - Blue Knob - 
in Central Pa.  The food was good and 
on par for the course, pretty cheap too. 
We got to listen to some live music in the bar area too. 

There's not a whole lot else here, but I think if you're 
going to Loveland, that's part of the reason why. People 
come here to ski a really fun mountain at an affordable price.

One last thing. I was peeking at the Loveland website while
writing this post and came across what might be called an
amenity. I almost forgot because both times I've been at 
Loveland, the winds have been to bad to be up high on the
mountain. Loveland has a FREE snowcat that all you need to 
do to ride is ask for a sticker (or something like that) at
the ticket window in the morning. This apparently takes you out
across the continental divide where you can drop in and 
let the fall line navigate you back to a lift.
