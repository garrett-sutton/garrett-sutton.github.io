## The TLDR
We went to Loveland on the last day of our
4 day family/friend trip to Colorado in March 2023. 
I had previously been to Loveland in
March 2021 and left feeling like there was more
to be desired. A former local even described it
to me as a "niche" resort prior to our trip. This day, however, completely flipped the 
script for me. Loveland was a close second to my favorite day of the trip (behind an absolutely
dreamy day at Vail).  

### The would I go back?
Most definitely! Loveland isn't probably the place
I'd want to spend an entire trip at, but it is a 
ton of fun for a day or 2. It has a lot of great 
intermediate-to-expert level terrain that doesn't seem to get bumped out nearly as much as a lot of other places I've been to. Most of the mountain isn't overly steep, allowing you to be creative and play through the various areas - high alpine bowls, groomers or trees. 

I also value a resort that is down-to-earth. Loveland 
has one of the cheapest lift tickets that I've 
seen in all of skiing, lacks the fancy amenities of other big resorts. You can tell skiing is the priority here!

## The human element
Loveland gives off a ragtag family vibe. It has terrain for everyone, with an affordable lift ticket and food. The latter two are almost unheard of 
at a ski resort circa 2023. 
There's no on-site lodging, so people are showing up 
with their eyes set on skiing. 

### The Crowds
We went to Loveland on a very windy Sunday. A lot of lifts were put on wind holds and eventually closed for the day. I imagine this isn't an all too uncommon occurrence since Loveland is situated on the Continental Divide. All of this is to say that by the end of the day, there were no crowds at all. We consistently skied down and right onto the lift. Even in the morning when some lifts were put on hold, it didn't seem like that many people ended up all congregated in a certain area. 

I think the forecasted high winds and the fact that said winds ended up coming to fruition certainly played a role in the limited amount of people we encountered. Additionally, Loveland not being classified as a destination resort like some of its neighbors - Breck, Keystone, Copper, etc - has to be considered as a consistent crowd limiter.
