## Months before
You have many thoughts as you're prepping 
to become a parent. There are nine months
of anxious anticipation and excitement. 
For me, I spent time 
pondering about things like what will 
she be interested in and how to guide her
through the Church and school and friends. 
I thought about how much my life would
change and how Grace and I's relationship
would change too. But of all the things,
I can't say I spent a ton of time thinking
about her actually coming out into the world.
I think I spent a lot more time thinking aboout
being a parent to a child rather than 
the hours before and first few days of
becoming a parent to a newborn. I was really
only aware of the fact that we had a due 
date and even that is sort of arbitrary. 

In early September, Grace let me know that
she could schedule an induction. So we go 
from "this baby might come any day" to 
"you can schedule when this baby comes." 
So we scheduled an induction for October 2 at 
5 a.m. - a few days
after the due date per doctor's recommendations.
For whatever reason, I was pretty convinced 
that Gwen was not going to come out without
some coaxing. We spent the days leading up to
the induction date doing pretty normal things - 
dinner at Novanta on Friday night, a long run
on Saturday while Grace went to Saturday
morning mass, mass on Sunday morning, and 
lunch at Buffalo Wild Wings with friends
while watching the Steelers get boatraced
by the Texans (sadface). 

### Aside - How did we come to Gwen Maria?
Grace and I spent a good amount of time combing
through lists of girl names when we found out we
were expecting a little girl. Girl names felt
hard. We were trying find a name that was unique
that balanced strength and elegance. 
Names came and went, but nothing really stuck. 
Grace was also telling everyone we didn't want a 
"G" name for obvious reasons. But then one day
we were looking through a list of saints and 
found Gwen. We discussed Gwenyth or Gwendlynn
but after thinking we wanted her to only be 
known by one name, Gwen it was. Of divine 
intervention or, at the very least, a beautiful
coincidence, Saint Gwen's feast day falls
on October 3!

For her middle name, we considered Goretti
for Saint Maria Goretti (our parish, the church
Grace and I were married in, and Grace's 
confirmation name). Grace worried Gwen could
end up as G.G. rather than Gwen because of this
though, so we landed on Maria instead.

## 10/2/2023 - Induction day
We woke up at 4 am on a Monday morning, got a 
few final things together, some food and hit
the road by about quarter til 5. We arrived
at the hospital to dark halls and very few
people. They got us into a triage room, where  
we realized Grace's phone was still at home. 
Once they got Grace got going with some 
induction things and nurses assured me I had
time to go home for the phone. I was only 
slightly nervous.

After I got back, the doctor came into the 
room for the first time. She mentioned she
expected the induction to take between 24 &
48 hours for a first time mom. I realized 
my nerviousness from my trip home was
completely unfounded and my estimate of Gwen
arriving by 2 pm on 10/2 was equally ludacris.

While still in the triage room, Grace felt 
her first contraction. According to her, it
was really light, but it definitely felt like
something. I immediately exclaimed "This is
going to be such a fun day." I think this raw
reaction really speaks to the fact that I 
was still somewhat unsure of what to expect of
childbirth. When you really think about it,
it's even a bit insensitive to what Grace was
going to go through later on in the day. 

Around 7 AM, we got moved up to a delivery room
from the triage room. After that, we spent a 
good portion of the day just hanging out. Other
than the fact we weren't in the comforts of our
own home, it resembled a lazy day. I listened
to some of the Pittsburgh radio reaction to the
Steelers loss from the day before. We both read
books, played on our phones and played cards
for a little while. Gwen still wasn't super
anxious to make an appearance. Of note, we did
not sleep at all during the day after getting
up at 4 am.

Eventually a shift change happened and the next
doctor-resident combo came in and met with us. They 
were presenting the idea of breaking Grace's 
water and getting things moving a bit faster. 
Grace obliged and within a few hours, it was
starting to feel a lot more real. I was also
starting to feel a lot more tired. I remember we had turned
on Monday Night Football to watch the Seahawks beat
up on the Giants. I was dozing in-and-out of the 
game when Grace started to get strong and more 
frequent contractions. I got a little bit of rest
in but was promptly woken up because Grace was really
starting to feel some pain. Up to this point, she
was really skeptical on whether or not she would 
want to get an epidural. I was beat and made the
very inopportune request for another 30 minutes
of sleep. To which she replied, "No, I need you now."

She decided on getting the epidural at the
perfect time and until it
actually got into her system, there were some  
painful moments for Grace and tense moments for me as 
I tried to do what I could to comfort her. After it 
was placed, we were really in good shape. Grace was able
to rest a little bit and I was also able to rest a 
little bit. It wasn't great rest though becasue
the nurses kept coming back in to make sure things
were alright. They weren't quite seeing the readings
they wanted on Gwen (I think maybe on Grace too), so 
they'd come in to change some sensors around or some
fluids or something like that. I say it like I was in the 
dark because it sort of felt like we were a bit in the
dark. There wasn't anything seriously wrong and I think 
the nurses just didn't want to alarm us. Having a baby is
already stressful enough. They didn't want to add to it
any more than they had to. As I laid on the couch trying
for sleep through these check-ins, I'd be remiss to not
mention I prayed for most of that time. There's just not
much else you can do at that point. Eventually midnight
came and went. I still had no clue on what to expect 
on how soon baby Gwen would arrive. 

## 10/3/2023
The hours leading up to midnight on 10/2 laid the way
for the first few hours of 10/3. Nurses checking in,
Grace and I getting some rest here and there, and not a 
whole lot else. Grace was pretty much just chilling with
the epidural. No pain at all at this point. I'm quite glad
she got it too. At maybe 2 AM, the doctor came in to do a
check on Grace to see how far along she was. She exclaimed,
"You're fully dialated!" After a long long day of hanging
around, it finally felt like we were really close! We'd 
get to meet our baby Gwen soon!

And at 3:48 AM, we had our beautiful baby girl!! 
Grace was remarkable and I managed to stay upright. I did
give everyone in the room a bit of a scare at one point,
but based on past experiences I don't think I was even
close to passing out. Anyway, now we have a baby! Gwen came
out looking to eat her hands and her mom and automatically grabbed
my finger when I placed it in her hand. It was
amazing to see how quickly she could come into the world and
know what she needed. And then it was awesome for me to be able 
to interact with her so quickly.

Nurses and doctors did what they needed to do to make sure
Grace was alright, that Gwen was alright and got Gwen's
measurements. That all takes time and it took additional time
to get us up to a postpartum suite. Exhausted, we got ourselves
situated, I took a shower, and we all took a nap. I don't 
exagerate when I say this may have been the nicest nap of my life. 
But it also may have been the most ominous nap of my life. 
I came to realize that if Gwen woke up, there wasn't going to be
anyone else to come running in to take care of her. It was up
to Grace and I. I never gave this thought before Gwen and now we 
were welcomed into a whole new reality. 

## Postpartum & coming home
After we got to the postpartum suite, I feel like most of the
rest of the time was spent trying to figure out how to get some
sleep between doctors/nurses coming to check-in, Gwen's needs,
and us eating. I will never forget the first night (night of October 3).
We were obviously still very tired after the marathon that was
getting through delivery and only getting a few small naps in during the 
day. To our surprise, Gwen started cluster feeding that night.
In the classes we'd taken, we didn't fully understand cluster
feeding. We both took it as, after 24+ hours of life, your baby
will start to eat basically every hour for another 24 hours. What
we didn't realize was twofold: 1) They can start this behavior
before 24 hours of life. It's not like they have a 24 hour clock
that says "NOW." And 2) This cluster feeding behavior lasts much
much longer than 24 hours. This constant feeding almost put
both of us over the edge. Grace obviously had to be up to feed
Gwen eat time. But I also had to be up becasue Grace was still
recovering from labor and the effects of the epidural. Without fail, 
every single time Gwen ate, she immediately pooped. I learned very 
quickly about changing diapers and trying to swaddle her back
up. With the meconium in each poop, it wasn't an easy "wipe once
and done" deal. Each diaper routinely needed a through wiping
to get the stickiness off too. And then there was figuring out 
a reliable swaddle that would contain Gwen's arms and hands. 

Put frankly, it was really hard to keep up with, not get poop 
everywhere and execute on a double swaddle such that she didn't end 
up out (and inevitably awake) of it in 10 minutes. Our nurses
were gracious enough to help when they were in the room, but 
it was largely up to Grace and I. In these sitautions, 
I felt a lot of fear. I assume it was partially driven by me
being tired, but it kept passing through my head that this would
never end and I would never sleep again. Dramatic - I know. But 
it was really hard to grapple with. I'll go so far with an 
absolute statement to say, I blatanly would just give up on
anything else in the world that was this hard if I was this 
tired. But you simply can't. 

By Thursday morning (after arriving at 5 AM Monday), we were
cleared to head home. This was exciting and absolutely 
terrifying at the same time. I was certainly looking forward
to sleeping in my own bed and having time with just us and 
Gwen. On the other hand, there are so many 
things that could go "wrong" with a little one. In the 
hospital, it was immensely reassuring to know all you needed to do
was pull a cord and all of the nurses would be in to help
immediately. At home, it was going to be up to Grace and I
to keep a close eye on baby Gwen for any signs of her not
doing well. Again, this is one of those parenting realities
that - in my opinion - doesn't quite dawns on you until 
you're presented with it.

We got Gwen into her car seat with a minor freak out, to which
our nurse taught us the trick of swinging the seat (with her 
fastened in of course). She fell right asleep and stayed asleep
for the entire ride home. 

And we all lived happily ever after. ;)

===================

For whatever reason, I was pretty convinced 
that Gwen was not going to come out without
some coaxing. So


the hours before and few days after childbirth.

I think it is that hard to fathom that one day
it's you and your wife and the next it's you, 
your wife, and another tiny human that you're
suddenly responsible for. 

It's really a weird place to be in. You're given
a forecasted due date 9 months ago and left
to just sort of wait. There's prep with 
getting the essentials, losing a room to the
nursery, and then this looming reality that
my life is going to change a lot. But during
that time, I honestly didn't give childbirth
much thought. 

We had a due date. Grace was pretty
sure that Gwen wouldn't be here by then. I 
took her word for it and moved on with my days.

Then in late summer, Grace came home from a 
doctor's appointment and explained we could
schedule an induction at her next appointment. 
It started to feel even more weird. I haven't 
been thinking about the specifics of the day that
my child is going to arrive, but now I get a say
in what day she arrives. 

differ between what it's going to be like to be a parent VS what it is going to be 
like for a child to come out of your wife.
