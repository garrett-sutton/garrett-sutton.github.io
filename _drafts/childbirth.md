You have many thoughts as you're prepping 
to become a parent. There are nine months
of anxious anticipation and excitement. 
For me, I spent time 
pondering about things like what will 
she be interested in and how to guide her
through the Church and school and friends. 
I thought about how much my life would
change and how Grace and I's relationship
would change too. But of all the things,
I can't say I spent a ton of time thinking
about her actually coming out into the world.
I think I spent a long time thinking aboout
being a parent to a child rather than 
the hours before and first few days of
becoming a parent to a newborn. I was really
only aware of the fact that we had a due 
date and even that is sort of arbitrary. 

In early September, Grace informed me that
she could schedule an induction. So we go 
from "this baby might come any day" to 
"you can schedule when this baby comes." 
So we scheduled an induction a few days
after the due date per doctor's recommendations.

===================

For whatever reason, I was pretty convinced 
that Gwen was not going to come out without
some coaxing. So


the hours before and few days after childbirth.

I think it is that hard to fathom that one day
it's you and your wife and the next it's you, 
your wife, and another tiny human that you're
suddenly responsible for. 

It's really a weird place to be in. You're given
a forecasted due date 9 months ago and left
to just sort of wait. There's prep with 
getting the essentials, losing a room to the
nursery, and then this looming reality that
my life is going to change a lot. But during
that time, I honestly didn't give childbirth
much thought. 

We had a due date. Grace was pretty
sure that Gwen wouldn't be here by then. I 
took her word for it and moved on with my days.

Then in late summer, Grace came home from a 
doctor's appointment and explained we could
schedule an induction at her next appointment. 
It started to feel even more weird. I haven't 
been thinking about the specifics of the day that
my child is going to arrive, but now I get a say
in what day she arrives. 

differ between what it's going to be like to be a parent VS what it is going to be 
like for a child to come out of your wife.
