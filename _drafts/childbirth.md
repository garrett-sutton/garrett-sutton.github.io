## Months before
You have many thoughts as you're prepping 
to become a parent. There are nine months
of anxious anticipation and excitement. 
For me, I spent time 
pondering about things like what will 
she be interested in and how to guide her
through the Church and school and friends. 
I thought about how much my life would
change and how Grace and I's relationship
would change too. But of all the things,
I can't say I spent a ton of time thinking
about her actually coming out into the world.
I think I spent a lot more time thinking aboout
being a parent to a child rather than 
the hours before and first few days of
becoming a parent to a newborn. I was really
only aware of the fact that we had a due 
date and even that is sort of arbitrary. 

In early September, Grace let me know that
she could schedule an induction. So we go 
from "this baby might come any day" to 
"you can schedule when this baby comes." 
So we scheduled an induction for October 2 at 
5 a.m. - a few days
after the due date per doctor's recommendations.
For whatever reason, I was pretty convinced 
that Gwen was not going to come out without
some coaxing. We spent the days leading up to
the induction date doing pretty normal things - 
dinner at Novanta on Friday night, a long run
on Saturday while Grace went to Saturday
morning mass, mass on Sunday morning, and 
lunch at Buffalo Wild Wings with friends
while watching the Steelers get boatraced
by the Texans (sadface). 

### Aside - How did we come to Gwen Maria?
Grace and I spent a good amount of time combing
through lists of girl names when we found out we
were expecting a little girl. Girl names felt
hard. We were trying find a name that was unique
that balanced strength and elegance. 
Names came and went, but nothing really stuck. 
Grace was also telling everyone we didn't want a 
"G" name for obvious reasons. But then one day
we were looking through a list of saints and 
found Gwen. We discussed Gwenyth or Gwendlynn
but after thinking we wanted her to only be 
known by one name, Gwen it was. Of divine 
intervention or, at the very least, a beautiful
coincidence, Saint Gwen's feast day falls
on October 3!

For her middle name, we considered Goretti
for Saint Maria Goretti (our parish, the church
Grace and I were married in, and Grace's 
confirmation name). Grace worried Gwen could
end up as G.G. rather than Gwen because of this
though, so we landed on Maria instead.

## 10/2/2023 - Induction day
We woke up at 4 am on a Monday morning, got a 
few final things together, some food and hit
the road by about quarter til 5. We arrived
at the hospital to dark halls and very few
people. They got us into a triage room, where  
we realized Grace's phone was still at home. 
Once they got Grace got going with some 
induction things and nurses assured me I had
time to go home for the phone. I was only 
slightly nervous.

After I got back, the doctor came into the 
room for the first time. She mentioned she
expected the induction to take between 24 &
48 hours for a first time mom. I realized 
my nerviousness from my trip home was
completely unfounded and my estimate of Gwen
arriving by 2 pm on 10/2 was equally ludacris.

## The hospital & coming home


===================

For whatever reason, I was pretty convinced 
that Gwen was not going to come out without
some coaxing. So


the hours before and few days after childbirth.

I think it is that hard to fathom that one day
it's you and your wife and the next it's you, 
your wife, and another tiny human that you're
suddenly responsible for. 

It's really a weird place to be in. You're given
a forecasted due date 9 months ago and left
to just sort of wait. There's prep with 
getting the essentials, losing a room to the
nursery, and then this looming reality that
my life is going to change a lot. But during
that time, I honestly didn't give childbirth
much thought. 

We had a due date. Grace was pretty
sure that Gwen wouldn't be here by then. I 
took her word for it and moved on with my days.

Then in late summer, Grace came home from a 
doctor's appointment and explained we could
schedule an induction at her next appointment. 
It started to feel even more weird. I haven't 
been thinking about the specifics of the day that
my child is going to arrive, but now I get a say
in what day she arrives. 

differ between what it's going to be like to be a parent VS what it is going to be 
like for a child to come out of your wife.
