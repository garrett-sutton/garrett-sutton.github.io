## lead in
Around the time Gwen was born, I found out
I missed out on the Boston Marathon for this
year (2024) by ~90 seconds. Soon after, a college
teammate reached out about  
running the 2024 Chicago marathon instead. Of the
major marathons in the US, Chicago is by far the
easiest to get into. The 3:05 qualifying time 
for Chicago is seemingly the only boundary you
must overcome. For Boston, you need to run
at least 3 hours and then hope that many others
didn't also run faster than 3 hours (many others
did in my case). In New York, it seems like the
wild west. They broadcast an auto-qualifier of 2:53,
but even still, it seems that isn't enough. You 
seemingly just need to get lucky. I say this 
because people I know have had that auto-qualifier time
by upwards of 10 minutes and still not gotten in 
and it's unclear why. 

Anyway, I had an auto-qualifier time for Chicago
and in late 2023, I had a race on the calendar for
a year from then.

My main winter goal after signing up for Chicago was
largely similar to what it has been in previous years.
Stay healthy. I've had weird muscular injury issues in 
the past and most of the time, they seem to pop up in
the winter. A tweaked hammy, abductor/adductor pain, 
back pain, etc. I tend to think this happens because 
the body just isn't functioning the same in the winter.
The footing is a bit more uncertain, so I'm probably a
bit tense all around. It's cold out, so it's
hard for the body to loosen up on a run. And the
stretching afterward takes a lot of effort to feel
remotely loose. I've felt very noticeable differences
in how limber I am on random warm days in the winter vs
the normal cold days. 

I managed to stay healthy over the winter with a 
steady dose of easy running, pretty low volume, and
stretching well after almost 
every run. As winter turned to spring, I started
thinking it would be a good idea (& something fun) to 
run a race in the spring before really thinking
about Chicago. I found the Monona 20k. I didn't have
high expectations going into this race after a 
winter that didn't melt any snow, but our spring 
was nice enough that I was able to have a nice run
of workouts leading into the race. By race day,
I felt fit enough to not embarrass myself and had
a good time with embracing the suck. It works out 
nicely to take a little break before getting into
the swing of marathon training.

## how am I generating my plan
In my first marathon - the 2022 Twin Cities Marathon - I 
largely followed a program that I had made for Grace
in 2021. It had worked well for her and I was biased
to my own plan. This plan was loosely similar to the
Jack Daniel's training plan that was largely geared
toward 10k-half marathon running. It had 4 phases.
Phase 1 was largely easy running. Phase 2 was tempo
runs and hills. Phase 3 was tempo running and vo2 
max intervals. Phase 4 was the taper. In each phase
of the plan, there were intentional long-run efforts
at around marathon pace too. Admittedly, I started
training for this marathon a bit late. I was intentionally
getting after it starting in July for an early October
race. So take some of this with a grain of salt. But
when I finished that first marathon, I specifically noted
that I would have liked to have been better about more
marathon-paced running. On race day, I felt like
I wasn't confident enough to run at the pace
that I needed to. Specifically, my goal pace was 6:30,
so in reality, you are going to need to run some miles
in the 6:20s. I was consistently running in the 6:30s
during the race, but that isn't going to bring home the
bacon. I was also a bit suspicious of how much the vo2 max
intervals that I did were helping me for the marathon. 
For my Chicago buildup, I determined that I 
wanted to try something a bit different. There's also
a reality that with a baby at home, it was going to 
have to be a bit different.

My search for a marathon training plan started as it
would for most people - by googling "marathon training
plans." This search felt like it left a lot to be
desired though. Plans seemed overly generic or they
seemed like they were prescribing a ton of hard running
that felt like it would be difficult for me to keep up
with. In reading about other running things, I was 
consistently hearing the concept used by the Norwegians
called Double Threshold Training. The idea is pretty simple -
run 2 threshold workouts in a single day. This 
encourages an athlete to not overcook their threshold workouts
and accumulate a really large volume of threshold work.
This seemed interesting though I wouldn't have time to 
run 2 workouts in a day. I plan to write another post about
this type of training in the future. Stay tuned for that.

In reading Jack Daniel's Running Formula, it seemed 
apparent that everyone has specific marathon training needs. 
In all other distances, he has a pretty one-size-fits-all 
approach. For the marathon, he provides 5 different 
approaches. Though I don't actually know my "marathon sweet
spot", I didn't feel like any of those plans met my needs
either. With these things in mind, I started to formulate a picture
of what I wanted my plan to look like for this 
marathon cycle.

## high-level plan
There are 2 big things I want to implement in this training
block. 
1. Do more long runs that emphasize running at or better
than marathon pace. I'd like to do an every-other-week 
pattern of long-run workout and then a longer long run
that is entirely easy. The long run workouts should 
try to get as many 10-20 minute intervals (with maybe 5 
minutes rest) at marathon pace during the run as possible.
The goal of these workouts is to gain confidence in the 
pace without going to the well (hence the decent rest).
1. Try my flavor of the double threshold. I don't have the
time or desire to double at all, let alone do two workouts
in a single day. I want to adapt the popularized approach
to do threshold workouts on back-to-back days. I think
this will suit me well. With Grace also running in the 
mornings, I don't necessarily have time to run long
marathon workouts without getting up earlier than what
seems reasonable. And because I know that I'm going to
have these back-to-back workouts, it probably helps me 
to keep each workout in check, while accumulating more
threshold volume than I would have in a single workout.

I'll plan to use a 4 phase approach to this marathon block.

### phase 1
This is the most simple phase. I took a small break after
the Monona 20k and need a few weeks to get my legs back
into the swing of things. This phase may include some
strides, but otherwise - no workouts.

### phase 2
This phase is meant to build general fitness and strength.
I plan to start doing 
workouts during this phase. In the early weeks, I'll 
plan to do a single workout during the week. Once I feel
comfortable with how much tempo volume I am doing, I'll
split it into 2 workouts on back-to-back days. When I 
start doing 2 workouts, I plan on day 1 being longer
tempo intervals (think 5-10 mins T w/ 1-2 mins off) 
and day 2 being shorter but faster intervals with shorter 
rest (think 30-90 sec @ 5k-10k pace w/ 30 sec off). I 
would like to do some hill repeats during these workouts
as well. 

I won't designate a day specifically for hills 
because I feel like they could go on either day. There's 
the case to do them on day 1 so that my legs get some
good turnover and change speeds. 
This could also mean some extra something
in my legs that makes the next day's workout more difficult
than it should be. It could
also be better from a time standpoint to do these with 
shorter intervals (day 2) because the workouts are likely 
shorter. I air on the side of day 1 and use 
these hills as strides of sorts at the time of writing, 
but will need to be cognizant of how I'm feeling. 

I'd also like to build long runs into the every-other-week
pattern (mentioned above) during this phase. Ideally,
I can build the volume of my long runs up so that the
easy ones are around 2 hours and the workout ones are 
about 90 minutes long. This will be a gradual build
in long-run volume though. I don't want to jump in too 
fast.  

I anticipate that this phase should start the week of June
17 and continue for 8 weeks. During these 8 weeks, we are 
going to France for 2 weeks. I hope to keep running on target
during the trip, but it may be difficult to get everything
in like I would from home. The goal during this trip 
should largely be to do what I can and not try to force
anything. This is a unique trip and I need to 
embrace that above running. The last week of this phase will
start on August 5. I should also have at least 1 "down" 
week during this phase. I think that week likely means a 
shorter easy long run and only 1 workout.

### phase 3
This phase is meant to cover marathon-specific training.
I plan to continue doing the back-to-back workout days
during this phase. The workouts start to include marathon-paced 
running on day 2 of the back-to-back. I think day 1 could be
either the shorter or longer tempo intervals (like what
is mentioned in phase 2). Day 2 should include marathon-paced
running with traditional tempo pace (i.e. those I can do with 5:1
on/off ratio) mixed in. I think these day 2 workouts should
have no rest and be continuous efforts navigating between
marathon pace and tempo pace. The tempo pace time doesn't necessarily
need to be 5 minutes long - just the pace I'd run for a 
5 min tempo interval.

Long runs during this phase should be the longest that they'll
ever be. I'd like to get 2 or 3 runs in that are 2.5 hours.
Assuming I can get to the 2.5-hour mark, I think the other
weeks would be 2 hour long runs with marathon-pace intervals
during the run.

This phase should start the week of August 12 and continue for
6-7 weeks. The last
week should be the week that starts September 16 or 23. I don't think
I should have any notable disruptions from the standard 
routine during this phase.

### phase 4
This is the taper. During this phase, I anticipate continuing
to do marathon-specific work to continue gaining confidence in
the pace. I'll also gradually decrease the long run duration
to 10 miles the week before the race. 

### wrapping up
I intentionally didn't specify specific mileage
totals, specific workouts, or long-run durations in the plan
above. In an early draft edition of this post, I did have 
those things but decided against including them here. I think
that having a high-level idea is probably a better approach for
me. I have tended in the past to be so committed to the
plan that I end up not listening to my body, potentially a
bit burnt out, and maybe even hurt. This will also be helpful
in not putting too much pressure on myself when some of the
normal disruptions to the routine occur. And ultimately,
I'll be able to feel the specifics as I go rather than try
to stick to specific workouts and volume numbers that couldn't
take into account how I would be feeling when I get 
there. 

Using the guidelines and goals that I mentioned above for each
phase, I think I'll create a workout plan for each week when
I get there. Each week, I'll likely have a minutes target as 
well that makes sense based on the time I have that week and
how I was feeling over the previous weeks at whatever volume. 
The advantage here is that I don't have to guess weeks/months 
in advance when I will need an easier week. 

When training
for the Twin Cities Marathon in 2022, I didn't necessarily
set mileage goals and it felt like it worked pretty well for me.
I was able to do my workouts and fill in the blanks on easy days
without pressure (from myself) to hit an arbitrary mileage
number. Of course, consistency is key, but a few weeks here
and there of varying mileage will happen and that
can be a good thing. I hope that by starting training for 
Chicago earlier than I did 2 years ago, in addition to having
a better base of miles in my legs to start training, that I'll
naturally be able to run some more miles this time around. 

Below I made a really simple table just to visualize 
the plan at a high level. It relies on understanding the
phases that I outlined above.

## when race day gets here
I've now spent a lot of time not talking about the race itself.
Part of that is because "it's all about the journey", but it's
also that I have always enjoyed training more than actual racing.
It's generally less pressure to just show up every day rather than to 
show up and perform on a single day. 

To perform on a single day, you spend way too much 
time thinking about the race (i.e. evidenced
from the above) and then spend many hours over months and months for 
hopefully under 3 hours of running. And there's a tendency leading
into race day to feel like all of the time that you've put in is
wasted time if the race doesn't go as you wanted. It's a
vulnerable position to put yourself in. You risk having
spent a ton of time to ultimately fail to reach your goal.

The marathon adds another element to this. It's generally
a "you've got one shot" type of race -- partially 
because there might not be another race and partially because
there's a good chance you're still wrecked even after a bad day.
And a bad day may be entirely out of your control. A bad day of 
weather, a bad day for your stomach, or a bad day for your legs 
can all end up the same, with a missed goal and a feeling of a lot
of wasted time. With the risk, it can feel like it can't possibly 
be worth it to pour yourself into something when there are 
so many unknowns.

I acknowledge that this negativity comes from fear. But I think 
the key thing for me to keep in mind during this training
cycle is that the race doesn't have to be validation of all of 
the time I've spent leading into race day. I'll most likely
continue running after this marathon and I'll most likely try
to run another marathon in the future. So sure, having a good
race day will be awesome, but I would likely still be running
whether this race was on the calendar or not. Getting outside
most mornings regardless of the weather, and feeling
something every once and a while are what make it worth it. 

There's also the reality that I've faced many times in the past.
That is - good training does not equate to a good race, at 
any distance. It's the classic saying that correlation does not equal 
causation. It feels really important to keep this in 
mind during training but also on race day. Running in general,
but especially the marathon, is as much mental as it is physical. 
Keeping calm and staying positive go a long way during the long 
slow burn of 26.2 miles.

To put something on paper, my goal for this year's Chicago Marathon
is to run under 2:50. This was my goal 2 years ago and I don't know
how good of a shot I had. I was off the pace through the half
and eventually had some bad cramping in both legs that I claim
lost me 2+ minutes. I eventually made it across the line in 
2:55. This time around, I'd like to give myself a shot through halfway, 
do a better job of fueling before and during the race, and see what happens
after that. 

Book it!
