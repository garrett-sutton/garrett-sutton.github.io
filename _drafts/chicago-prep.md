## lead in
Around the time Gwen was born, I found out
I had missed out on the Boston marathon for this
year (2024) by ~90 seconds. Soon after, a college
teammate reached out about the prospect of 
running the 2024 Chicago marathon instead. Of the
major marathons in the US, Chicago is by far the
easiest to get into. The 3:05 qualifying time 
for Chicago is seemingly the only boundary you
need to overcome. For Boston, you need to run
at least 3 hours and then hope that many others
didn't also run faster than 3 hours (many others
did in my case). In New York, it seems like the
wild west. They broadcast an auto-qualifier of 2:53,
but even still, it seems that isn't enough. You 
seemingly just need to get lucky. I say this 
because people I know have had that auto-qualifier time
my upwards of 10 minutes and still not gotten in 
and it's unclear why. 

Anyway, I had an auto-qualifier time for Chicago
and in late 2023, I had a race on the calendar for
a year from then.

My main winter goal after signing up for Chicago was
largely similar to what it has been in previous years.
Stay healthy. I've had weird muscular injury issues in 
the past and most of the time, they seem to pop up in
the winter. A tweaked hammy, abductor/adductor pain, 
back pain, etc. I tend to think this happens because 
the body just isn't functioning the same in the winter.
The footing is a bit more uncertain, so I'm probably a
bit tense all around. It's freezing cold out, so it's
hard for the body to loosen up on a run. And the
stretching afterwards takes a lot of effort to feel
remotely loose. I've felt very noticeable differences
in how limber I am on random warm days in the winter vs
the normal cold days. 

I managed to stay healthy over the winter with a 
steady dose of easy running, pretty low volume, and
stretching really well after almost 
every run. As winter turned to spring, I started
thinking it would be a good idea (& something fun) to 
run a race in the spring before really thinking
about Chicago. I found the Monona 20k. I didn't have
high expectations going into this race after a 
winter that didn't melt any snow, but our spring 
was nice enough that I was able to have a nice run
of workouts leading into the race. By race day,
I felt fit enough to not embarass myself and had
a good time with embracing the suck. It works out 
nicely to take a little break before getting into
the swing of marathon training.
