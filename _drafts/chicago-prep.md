## lead in
Around the time Gwen was born, I found out
I had missed out on the Boston marathon for this
year (2024) by ~90 seconds. Soon after, a college
teammate reached out about the prospect of 
running the 2024 Chicago marathon instead. Of the
major marathons in the US, Chicago is by far the
easiest to get into. The 3:05 qualifying time 
for Chicago is seemingly the only boundary you
need to overcome. For Boston, you need to run
at least 3 hours and then hope that many others
didn't also run faster than 3 hours (many others
did in my case). In New York, it seems like the
wild west. They broadcast an auto-qualifier of 2:53,
but even still, it seems that isn't enough. You 
seemingly just need to get lucky. I say this 
because people I know have had that auto-qualifier time
my upwards of 10 minutes and still not gotten in 
and it's unclear why. 

Anyway, I had an auto-qualifier time for Chicago
and in late 2023, I had a race on the calendar for
a year from then.

My main winter goal after signing up for Chicago was
largely similar to what it has been in previous years.
Stay healthy. I've had weird muscular injury issues in 
the past and most of the time, they seem to pop up in
the winter. A tweaked hammy, abductor/adductor pain, 
back pain, etc. I tend to think this happens because 
the body just isn't functioning the same in the winter.
The footing is a bit more uncertain, so I'm probably a
bit tense all around. It's freezing cold out, so it's
hard for the body to loosen up on a run. And the
stretching afterwards takes a lot of effort to feel
remotely loose. I've felt very noticeable differences
in how limber I am on random warm days in the winter vs
the normal cold days. 

I managed to stay healthy over the winter with a 
steady dose of easy running, pretty low volume, and
stretching really well after almost 
every run. As winter turned to spring, I started
thinking it would be a good idea (& something fun) to 
run a race in the spring before really thinking
about Chicago. I found the Monona 20k. I didn't have
high expectations going into this race after a 
winter that didn't melt any snow, but our spring 
was nice enough that I was able to have a nice run
of workouts leading into the race. By race day,
I felt fit enough to not embarass myself and had
a good time with embracing the suck. It works out 
nicely to take a little break before getting into
the swing of marathon training.

## how am I generating my plan
In my first marathon - 2022 Twin Cities Marathon - I 
largely followed a program that I had made for Grace
in 2021. It had worked well for her and I was bias
to my own plan. This plan was loosely similar to 
Jack Daniel's training plan that was largely geared
toward 10k-half marathon running. It had 4 phases.
Phase 1 was largely easy running. Phase 2 was tempo
runs and hills. Phase 3 was tempo running and vo2 
max intervals. Phase 4 was the taper. In each phase
of the plan, there were intentional long run efforts
at around marathon pace too. Admittedly, I started
training for this marathon a bit late. I was intentionally
getting after it starting in July for an early October
race. So take some of this with a grain of salt. But
when I finished that first marathon, I specifically noted
that I would have liked to have been better about more
marathon paced running. On race day, I had felt like
I wasn't actually confident enough to run the pace
that I needed to. Specifically, my goal pace was 6:30,
so in reality, you are going to need to run some miles
in the 6:20s. I was consistently running in the 6:30s
during the race, but that isn't going to bring home the
bacon. I was also a bit suspect on how much the vo2 max
intervals that I did were helping me for the marathon. 
For my Chicago buildup, I determined that I 
wanted to try something a bit different. There's also
a reality that with a baby at home, it was going to 
have to be a bit different.

My search for a marathon training plan started as it
would for most people - by googling "marathon training
plans." This searching felt like it left a lot to be
desired though. Plans seemed overly generic or they
seemed like they were perscribing a ton of hard running
that felt like it would be difficult for me to keep up
with. In reading about other running things, I was 
consistently hearing the concept used by the Norwegains
called Double Treshold Training. The idea is pretty simple -
run 2 threshold workouts in a single day. This apparently
encourages an athlete to not overcook their threshold workouts
and accumulate a really large volume of threshold work.
This seemed interesting though I wouldn't have time to 
run 2 workouts in a day. I plan to write another post about
this type of training in the future. Stay tuned for that.

In reading the Jack Daniel's Running Formula, it seemed 
apparent that everyone has specific marathon training needs. 
In all other distances he has a pretty one sized fits all 
approach. For the marathon, he provides 5 different 
approaches. Though I don't actually know my "marathon sweet
spot", I didn't feel like any of those plans met my needs
either. With these things in mind, I started to formulate a picture
of what I wanted my plan to look like for this 
marathon cycle.
