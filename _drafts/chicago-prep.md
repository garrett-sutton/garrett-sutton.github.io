## lead in
Around the time Gwen was born, I found out
I had missed out on the Boston marathon for this
year (2024) by ~90 seconds. Soon after, a college
teammate reached out about the prospect of 
running the 2024 Chicago marathon instead. Of the
major marathons in the US, Chicago is by far the
easiest to get into. The 3:05 qualifying time 
for Chicago is seemingly the only boundary you
need to overcome. For Boston, you need to run
at least 3 hours and then hope that many others
didn't also run faster than 3 hours (many others
did in my case). In New York, it seems like the
wild west. They broadcast an auto-qualifier of 2:53,
but even still, it seems that isn't enough. You 
seemingly just need to get lucky. I say this 
because people I know have had that auto-qualifier time
my upwards of 10 minutes and still not gotten in 
and it's unclear why. 

Anyway, I had an auto-qualifier time for Chicago
and in late 2023, I had a race on the calendar for
a year from then.
