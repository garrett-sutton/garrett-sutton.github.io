## lead in
Around the time Gwen was born, I found out
I had missed out on the Boston marathon for this
year (2024) by ~90 seconds. Soon after, a college
teammate reached out about the prospect of 
running the 2024 Chicago marathon instead. Of the
major marathons in the US, Chicago is by far the
easiest to get into. The 3:05 qualifying time 
for Chicago is seemingly the only boundary you
need to overcome. For Boston, you need to run
at least 3 hours and then hope that many others
didn't also run faster than 3 hours (many others
did in my case). In New York, it seems like the
wild west. They broadcast an auto-qualifier of 2:53,
but even still, it seems that isn't enough. You 
seemingly just need to get lucky. I say this 
because people I know have had that auto-qualifier time
my upwards of 10 minutes and still not gotten in 
and it's unclear why. 

Anyway, I had an auto-qualifier time for Chicago
and in late 2023, I had a race on the calendar for
a year from then.

My main winter goal after signing up for Chicago was
largely similar to what it has been in previous years.
Stay healthy. I've had weird muscular injury issues in 
the past and most of the time, they seem to pop up in
the winter. A tweaked hammy, abductor/adductor pain, 
back pain, etc. I tend to think this happens because 
the body just isn't functioning the same in the winter.
The footing is a bit more uncertain, so I'm probably a
bit tense all around. It's freezing cold out, so it's
hard for the body to loosen up on a run. And the
stretching afterwards takes a lot of effort to feel
remotely loose. I've felt very noticeable differences
in how limber I am on random warm days in the winter vs
the normal cold days. 

I managed to stay healthy over the winter with a 
steady dose of easy running, pretty low volume, and
stretching really well after almost 
every run. As winter turned to spring, I started
thinking it would be a good idea (& something fun) to 
run a race in the spring before really thinking
about Chicago. I found the Monona 20k. I didn't have
high expectations going into this race after a 
winter that didn't melt any snow, but our spring 
was nice enough that I was able to have a nice run
of workouts leading into the race. By race day,
I felt fit enough to not embarass myself and had
a good time with embracing the suck. It works out 
nicely to take a little break before getting into
the swing of marathon training.

## how am I generating my plan
In my first marathon - 2022 Twin Cities Marathon - I 
largely followed a program that I had made for Grace
in 2021. It had worked well for her and I was bias
to my own plan. This plan was loosely similar to 
Jack Daniel's training plan that was largely geared
toward 10k-half marathon running. It had 4 phases.
Phase 1 was largely easy running. Phase 2 was tempo
runs and hills. Phase 3 was tempo running and vo2 
max intervals. Phase 4 was the taper. In each phase
of the plan, there were intentional long run efforts
at around marathon pace too. Admittedly, I started
training for this marathon a bit late. I was intentionally
getting after it starting in July for an early October
race. So take some of this with a grain of salt. But
when I finished that first marathon, I specifically noted
that I would have liked to have been better about more
marathon paced running. On race day, I had felt like
I wasn't actually confident enough to run the pace
that I needed to. Specifically, my goal pace was 6:30,
so in reality, you are going to need to run some miles
in the 6:20s. I was consistently running in the 6:30s
during the race, but that isn't going to bring home the
bacon. I was also a bit suspect on how much the vo2 max
intervals that I did were helping me for the marathon. 
For my Chicago buildup, I determined that I 
wanted to try something a bit different. There's also
a reality that with a baby at home, it was going to 
have to be a bit different.

My search for a marathon training plan started as it
would for most people - by googling "marathon training
plans." This searching felt like it left a lot to be
desired though. Plans seemed overly generic or they
seemed like they were perscribing a ton of hard running
that felt like it would be difficult for me to keep up
with. In reading about other running things, I was 
consistently hearing the concept used by the Norwegains
called Double Treshold Training. The idea is pretty simple -
run 2 threshold workouts in a single day. This apparently
encourages an athlete to not overcook their threshold workouts
and accumulate a really large volume of threshold work.
This seemed interesting though I wouldn't have time to 
run 2 workouts in a day. I plan to write another post about
this type of training in the future. Stay tuned for that.

In reading the Jack Daniel's Running Formula, it seemed 
apparent that everyone has specific marathon training needs. 
In all other distances he has a pretty one sized fits all 
approach. For the marathon, he provides 5 different 
approaches. Though I don't actually know my "marathon sweet
spot", I didn't feel like any of those plans met my needs
either. With these things in mind, I started to formulate a picture
of what I wanted my plan to look like for this 
marathon cycle.

## high level plan
There are 2 big things I want to implement in this training
block. 
1. Do more long runs that emphasize running at or better
than marathon pace. I'd like to do an every other week 
pattern of long run workout and then a longer long run
that is entirely easy. The long run workouts should 
try to get as many 10-20 minute intervals (with maybe 5 
minutes rest) at marathon pace during the run as possible.
The goal of these workouts is to gain confidence in the 
pace without going to the well (hence the decent rest).
1. Try my own flavor of double threshold. I don't have the
time or desire to double at all, let alone do two workouts
in a single day. I want to adapt the popularized approach
to do threshold workouts on back-to-back days. I think
this will suit me well. With Grace also running in the 
mornings, I don't necessarily have time to run long
marathon workouts without getting up earlier than what
seems reasonable. And because I know that I'm going to
have these back-to-back workouts, it probably helps me 
to keep each workout in check, while accumulating more
threshold volume that I would have in a single workout.

I'll plan to use a 4 phase approach to this marathon block.

### phase 1
This is the most simple phase. I took a small break after
the Monona 20k and need a few weeks to get my legs back
into the swing of things. This phase may include some
strides, but otherwise - no workouts.

### phase 2
This phase is meant to build general fitness and strength.
I plan to start doing 
workouts during this phase. In the early weeks, I'll 
plan to do a single workout during the week. Once I feel
comfortable in how much tempo volume I am doing, I'll
split it into 2 workouts on back-to-back days. When I 
start doing 2 workouts, I plan on day 1 being longer
tempo intervals (think 5-10 mins T w/ 1-2 mins off) 
and day 2 being shorter but faster intervals with shorter 
rest (think 30-90 sec @ 5k-10k pace w/ 30 sec off). I 
would like to do some hill repeats during these workouts
as well. 

I won't designate a day specifically for hills 
because I feel like they could go on either day. There's 
the case to do them on day 1 so that my legs get some
good turnover and really change speeds. 
This could also mean some extra something
in my legs that makes the next day's workout more difficult
than it should be. It could
also be better from a time standpoint to do these with 
the shorter intervals (day 2) because the workouts are likely 
shorter. I air on the side of day 1 and using 
these hills as a strides of sorts at the time of writing, 
but will need to be cognizant of how I'm feeling. 

I'd also like to build long runs into the every other week
pattern (mentioned above) during this phase. Ideally,
I can build the volume of my long runs up so that the
easy ones are around 2 hours and the workout ones are 
about 90 minutes long. This will be a gradual build
in long run volume though. I don't want to jump in too 
fast.  

I anticipate that this phase should start the week of June
17 and continue for 8 weeks. During these 8 weeks, we are 
going to France for 2 weeks. I hope to keep running on target
during the trip, but it may be difficult to get everything
in like I would from home. The goal during this trip 
should largely be to do what I can and not try to force
anything. This is a really unique trip and I need to 
embrace that above running. The last week of this phase will
start on August 5. I should also have at least 1 "down" 
week during this phase. I think that week likely means a 
shorter easy long run and only 1 workout.

### phase 3
This phase is meant to cover marathon specific training.
I plan to continue doing the back-to-back workout days
during this phase. The workouts start to include marathon
paced running on day 2 of the back to back. I think day 1 could be
either the shorter or longer tempo intervals (like what
is mentioned in phase 2). Day 2 should include marathon paced
running with traditional tempo pace (i.e. those I can do with 5:1
on/off ratio) mixed in. I think these day 2 workouts should
have no rest and be continous efforts navigating between
marathon pace and tempo pace. The tempo pace time doesn't necessarily
need to be 5 minutes long - just the pace I'd run for a 
5 min tempo interval.

Long runs during this phase should be the longest that they'll
every be. I'd really like to get 2 or 3 runs in of 2.5 hours.
Assuming I can get to the 2.5 hour mark, I think the other
weeks would be 2 hour long runs with marathon pace intervals
during the run.

This phase should start the week of August 12 and continue for
6-7 weeks. The last
week should be the week that starts September 16 or 23. I don't think
I should have any notable disruptions from the standard 
routine during this phase.

### phase 4
This is the taper. During this phase, I anticipate continuing
to do marathon specific work to continue gaining confidence in
the pace. I'll also gradually decrease the long run duration
to 10 miles the week before the race.
