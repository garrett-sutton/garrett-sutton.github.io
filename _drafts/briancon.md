For our trip to France in summer 2024, we went from the Tour
de France finish in Nice to a small town in the Alps called
Briancon.

## What did we do?
While in Briancon, we had a few "bigger" activites that we wanted
to do but no real plan on when to do them. 


## what was it like?
TODO: talk language barrier. food. coffee. breakfast
## Did it live up to expectations?
