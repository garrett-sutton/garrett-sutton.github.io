The unofficial biggest loser of the tour de france is known as 
the lanterne rouge - that is the red lantern. I found this book
while looking through the sports section at the library one 
day. I was initially drawn because our trip to France was on the
horizon. But after reading some of the reviews, I was also drawn
to the stories of perserverance and how that may provide an 
analog to everyday life. I read this book before during and after 
our trip and enjoyed it a lot.

Generally speaking, the author goes
through stories of various guys that finished last in the tour
de france. And in doing so, he makes an effort to highlight the
fact that these guys are still very impressive at riding a bike
to even finish and that the team aspect of the tour de france 
makes it such that the guy finishing last really may not be the
worst rider in the tour. 

## how hard is the tour
The book goes through the origin stories of the tour. And with
those stories, it highlights that the founder wanted the race
to be extremely hard to finish. Allegedly, his ideal tour would
have been one where only 1 rider could finish. This alleged
dream never came to fruition, but the sentiment is what
matters. It's hard to imagine riding nearly 100 miles per
day in all types of weather conditions, over huge mountains,
at ridiculous speeds for three weeks. I'd like to think I'm 
a relatively fit individual, but each year I have done the MS ride 
(i.e. not a race - with lots of snacks and breaks), I have found
myself in a hole. And this ride is only ever a maximum of 100 
miles. The confidence I gain from watching the tour quickly
disappears in the form of humble pie.

Cycling also has a dark past. And the book does acknowledge it 
for a chapter. But interestingly, the author highlights that
even with doping, you weren't a guarantee to be at the front. The
media commonly focuses on the riders who won while on drugs, but
it doesn't highlight the fact that drugs can also put you at
the back of the race. Some riders were into more than PEDs and
they paid for it in the form of suffering endlessly over the course
of the tour. Given that even cheating couldnt' keep them out of 
last, it speaks again to just how hard the race is.

## value from the back
talk sponsors and such
talk combativity

## my takeaways
Now, as I write this post after being at the tour for a few days
and seeing some of the big climbs, I have a deeper appreciation
for the back of the race. I haven't started watching the tail of 
finishers to a stage on a tv, but I have a sense of how hard
it is for these guys to finish the race. I think it's pretty easy 
to watch the race on tv, see a guy like Tadej seemingly fly
up mountains in effortless fashion, and think everyone else is
slow or not tryingi hard enough. That's simply not true. 
These guys at the 
back are fighting each and every day to make it to the line
within the time cut. And even though they have sponsorships
and financial incentives to finish the tour, there is truly
a sense of pride in just getting to the finish line.
