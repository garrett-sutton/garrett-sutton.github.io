The unofficial biggest loser of the tour de france is known as 
the lanterne rouge - that is the red lantern. I found this book
while looking through the sports section at the library one 
day. I was initially drawn because our trip to France was on the
horizon. But after reading some of the reviews, I was also drawn
to the stories of perserverance and how that may provide an 
analog to everyday life. I read this book before during and after 
our trip and enjoyed it a lot.

Generally speaking, the author goes
through stories of various guys that finished last in the tour
de france. And in doing so, he makes an effort to highlight the
fact that these guys are still very impressive at riding a bike
to even finish and that the team aspect of the tour de france 
makes it such that the guy finishing last really may not be the
worst rider in the tour. 

## how hard is the tour
The book goes through the origin stories of the tour and how
the founders of the tour

## value from the back
talk sponsors and such
talk combativity

## my takeaways
Now, as I write this post after being at the tour for a few days
and seeing some of the big climbs, I have a deeper appreciation
for the back of the race. I haven't started watching the tail of 
finishers to a stage on a tv, but I have a sense of how hard
it is for these guys to finish the race. I think it's pretty easy 
to watch the race on tv, see a guy like Tadej seemingly fly
up mountains in effortless fashion, and think everyone else is
slow or not trying. That's simply not true. These guys at the 
back are fighting each and every day to make it to the line
within the time cut.
