Before checking this out, there's likely helpful
context about what sabbatical is and the reason
we're doing what we're doing in [my past post]({% link 
_posts/2024-1-17-initial-sabbatical-planning.md %}).
The purpose behind this post is to give some finer
details about how we plan to travel around and where
we plan to stay now that the vision has been ironed
out. Generally speaking, we can divide the 2 week
trip into 4 distinct parts:
- Nice / Tour de France
- Briançon / The Alps
- Paris / Olympics
- Normandy

## Nice / Tour de France
We're set to arrive in Nice in the late morning on 
Thursday July 18. From there, we'll get a rental car
and drive north of Nice to Valdeblore. The airbnb
we booked is at the top of La Colmiane and nicely
positioned a block away from the route for Stage 20
(Saturday) of this year's Tour de France. It is also
not far from the route for Stage 19, so we'll make a
determination in the coming months on what to do with
Friday. We can likely find a spot along the lower 
pointing of the Isola 2000 climb in the car or just 
get acclimated to the time change and take a hike 
from our airbnb.

On Saturday, I think we'll be all in on the Tour.
La Colmiane is the penultimate climb of the day. We'll
likely hang out around our place until the race comes
through and make our way back to Nice after the stage.
We have a hotel booked in Nice for Saturday night. It's 
still up in the air on whether we'll return the rental
car or keep it and find public parking for it on 
Saturday and Sunday night. Our hotel for Saturday and
Sunday night doesn't have any parking. 

For Sunday in Nice, we should be able to go to mass
close to our hotel and then take an easy walk to 
somewhere along the Stage 21 time trial course. 
Hopefully it is an easy enough day to see the race
and relax some. On Monday morning, we'll get our
stuff together and drive into the Alps.

### Side note
We had originally wanted to do a camper van 
for this leg of our journey. After doing some
research, it seemed like it might be more stress
than it was worth though. We weren't familiar enough 
with the area to know where we would sleep. Even if
we did find a spot, I wasn't confident in my ability to 
park this large van on the side of a mountain. And then
the kicker was that all of the camper van rentals
that we were looking at required renting for at least 4
days. We were looking to do 3 days maximum.
