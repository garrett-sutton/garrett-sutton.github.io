Before checking this out, there's likely helpful
context about what sabbatical is and the reason
we're doing what we're doing in [my past post]({% link 
_posts/2024-1-17-initial-sabbatical-planning.md %}).
The purpose of this post is to give some finer
details about how we plan to travel around and where
we plan to stay now that the vision has been ironed
out. Generally speaking, we can divide the 2 week
trip into 4 distinct parts:
- Nice / Tour de France
- Briançon / The Alps
- Paris / Olympics
- Normandy

## Nice / Tour de France
We're set to arrive in Nice in the late morning on 
Thursday, July 18. From there, we'll get a rental car
and drive north of Nice to Valdeblore. The Airbnb
we booked is at the top of La Colmiane and nicely
positioned a block away from the route for Stage 20
(Saturday) of this year's Tour de France. It is also
not far from the route for Stage 19, so we'll decide 
in the coming months what to do with
Friday. We can likely find a spot along the lower 
pointing of the Isola 2000 climb in the car or just 
get acclimated to the time change and take a hike 
from our Airbnb.

On Saturday, I think we'll be all in on the Tour.
La Colmiane is the penultimate climb of the day. We'll
likely hang out around our place until the race comes
through and make our way back to Nice after the stage.
We have a hotel booked in Nice for Saturday night. It's 
still up in the air on whether we'll return the rental
car or keep it and find public parking for it on 
Saturday and Sunday night. Our hotel for Saturday and
Sunday night doesn't have any parking. 

For Sunday in Nice, we should be able to go to mass
close to our hotel and then take an easy walk to 
somewhere along the Stage 21 time trial course. 
Hopefully, it is an easy enough day to see the race
and relax some. On Monday morning, we'll get our
stuff together and drive into the Alps.

### Side note
We had originally wanted to do a camper van 
for this leg of our journey. After doing some
research, it seemed like it might be more stress
than it was worth though. We weren't familiar enough 
with the area to know where we would sleep. Even if
we did find a spot, I wasn't confident in my ability to 
park this large van on the side of a mountain. And then
the kicker was that all of the camper van rentals
that we were looking at required renting for at least 4
days. We were looking to do 3 days maximum. 

## Briançon / The Alps
We'll stay in Briançon until Friday, likely making 
small day trips from our Airbnb and exploring the 
highest altitude village in France. On Friday 
morning, we'll start making our way to Paris.

## Paris
To get to Paris, we'll drive from Briançon to Lyon
and catch a train from Lyon to Paris. In Paris,
we have a hotel booked in the 6th Arrondissement
for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights. While in Paris,
we're planning on going to the Olympic rowing 
competition on Saturday and beach volleyball 
on Sunday. For all of our Paris navigation, we'll
use the train system. It's likely a 90-minute
train ride to the rowing center. And about a 
The 30-minute train ride from the hotel to the
Eiffel Tower for Sunday. 

## Normandy
In Normandy, we anticipate that we'll need a car
to get around to the various landmarks. Given the
need for a car, I think we'll plan to rent a 
car in Paris on Monday morning to drive 3 hours 
west to Normandy. We get some flexibility from this and 
are not beholden to the train schedule when we
come back on Tuesday night. We have a hotel
booked just outside of Bayeaux (the town closest
to the D-Day beaches) for Monday night.

We've considered taking a train to Normandy from
Paris, but it seems logistically harder and 
probably more expensive because:
- need to stay somewhere close to the train station
in Bayeaux (unless we look for more public transit)
- need to carry all of our bags with us on Tuesday
after we've already checked out of the hotel
- probably need to find a bus tour or some other
form of public transportation to make it
to the D-Day beaches.

Though it'd be more relaxing if we rode the train
from Paris and then rented
a car in Normandy to see everything, we'd still 
have to pay for the car for a day. 

In the end,
it seems like the most cost-effective and convienent
option to just rent a car. We'll drive back to 
Paris on Tuesday night and stay in a hotel 
close to the airport so that we're right there
on Wednesday for our flight back home.
