This post is largely going to sound like a Gwen appreciation
rather than a post on how to travel with a nine-month old.But
I do hope to highlight what it was like along the way.

## Preparation

### Could we do this?

We had been talking about going to France well before Gwen.
So when Gwen came into the picture, Grace would only continue
entertaining the conversation if Gwen was included in the trip.
I was admittedly a bit worried. I had never left the North 
American continent and now I was going to go to a foreign
country where English wasn't the primary language with a
nine-month old. 

### Gaining some confidence

We used our Christmas time 2023 travels as a trial run for
traveling with an infant. On that trip, we flew out of Milwaukee
to NY to spend time with Grace's family for Christmas and finished
off the trip with a friend's wedding in Georgia. This was a good
taste of how things would go for our trip. It had several 
transitions during the trip and gave us the opportunity to figure
out what it was like to carry our lives on our backs. In theory,
Gwen would also be more flexible for our trip to France since
she would be 6 months older. After this Christmas 2023 trip,
I think we were both tired but we had fun and didn't feel like
it was ridiculous to move forward with planning for France. 

We talked with Gwen's doctor about the trip and heard any any 
specific health considerations we shoudl take into account for
the trip. The big things that stand out to me were making sure
she was up-to-date on a few vaccines and that she had her own 
seat on the plane. The extra $1,000+ for a baby seat is tough
to stomach, but at the same time, one of us having to hold Gwen
for the duration of a transatlantic flight was going to be 
hard and likely unsafe if we wanted to sleep at all. 

### Planning

For actual trip planning, I pretty much planned to do most 
all of the big things that I think we would have done even
if Gwen wasn't around. We were going to the Tour de France, going to
the Olympics, spending time in a town in the Alps, and planning
to see some of the Normany region. When booking places to stay, I paid 
special attention to whether the place had a crib or pack'n'play
available for Gwen to sleep in. And with each stop along the way,
we tried to think of all of the Gwen things that we needed to
deal with so that things went smoothly. For example, we ran into
the unfornutate scenario that Gwen needed her own tickets to the
Olympics.    

### Packing

We were intentional about how our packing was giong to impact our
lives when on the ground. We had several transitions to account for
and different modes of tranportation along the way. I felt that the 
biggest factor in making our lives as easy as possible was to just
limit the amount of stuff that we had. Just because we were allowed
to fit things on a plane didn't mean that we shoudl try to maximize
what we were going to take. In my experience, the plane has typically
been the packing bottleneck. But for us, the real bottleneck was going
to be that we had some real miles to put on while carrying everything.

We would have had to pay an inordinate amount for a checked bag, but it 
wasn't going to be feasible to have a large checked back that we
needed to roller through cobblestone streets as we were transitioning 
between places anyway. We did bring our big Graco stroller and that was 
truly
helpful. One of us coudl carry and roll what was reasonable. Then most everything else could fit either one the others back or under the 
stroller.  

All total, we brought:
- Stroller
- Car seat
- Diaper bag
- Grace carry-on
- Garrett carry-on
- Gwen carry-on (a 50L hiking backpack)
- Grace personal item (a 20L daypack)

This is still a lot of stuff but we still came in a bit under what we were
"allowed" (i.e. Gwen and I didn't technically have a "personal item"). 

We tried to pack versatile clothes. And with it being summer time we didn't
need to worry too much. A few extra layers were helpful 
though. Knowing that 2 weeks of clothes is a lot, we were cognizant of the 
fact that we needed to do laundry. We were forunate the the one place
we stayed that had laundry (i.e. in the airBnb in the Alps) was right
in the middle of the trip. 

TODO: consider mentioning what we left behind and other things of what
we brought. Feels helpful to call out that we could buy things along the
way and that we didn't need to have EVERYTHIGN

## In action

### Bassinets are not real

During our preparation, we found various blogs and even the American
Airlines website mentioning of bassinets that could be used for
free on a first-come-first-serve basis. We figured this would be really
nice for Gwen to sleep comfortably and have a little bit more space 
than her car seat. 

I talked with folks from
American at an airport on a previous trip to try to get some insight
on how the whole bassinet thing worked. The answer that I consistently
got was that I would have to talk with people at the airport on the day
of travel. On arriving at the Madison airport, Grace went to the 
baggage counter to have that conversation and the attendant looked at
her like she had 3 heads. Grace was told we would have to wait to talk
to the gate agent in Philadelphia (right before the flight across the
pond). Talk about making us wait until the last minute. In all of the 
conversations Grace and I had and blogs that I read, no one every really
seemed to indicate much doubt in our ability to get a bassinet. Without
knowing any better, we figured this was just the process. 

So when we arrived at the gate in Philadelphia and the gate agents pretty 
bluntly said that we can't get a bassinet, I was a bit taken back. They
kept saying that you needed to be in the bulk head seat (which seemingly
we were not). Once we found out what the bulk head seat actually was, 
it became clear that this whole bassinet thing is not nearly as
accomodating as the American Airlines website made it out to be. When 
you book an international flight, you need to know beforehand what row
sits behind the bulk head. Yes - this means you need to know what model
of plane you'll be flying on. If and only if that row is available, you'll
have a chance of getting a bassinet. For us, we were SOL for this trip.
We were back in economy and Gwen was going to ahve to make due in 
her carseeat. 

After finding this out but prior to boarding, we were pretty nervous.
But those nerves never manifest into any real problems. Gwen took a 
little while to fall asleep that night as we got on our way from
Philly, but after she fell asleep, she stayed alseep for almost the 
entire flight to Nice. Luckily, Grace and I were able to get some 
rest too (as good as one can on an airplane that is).

Continuing on the topic of flying, Gwen also did really really well on
the way home too. This flight left Paris in the late afternoon and arrived 
in Chicago in the early evening. Again, Gwen slept for a good portion of 
the flight and was pretty content for most of the time that she was awake.
She was a very good baby. On coming home, this is one of the biggest 
pieces that people talk with us about and I can confidently say it
went about as smooth as you could possibly imagine.

### we just want to be home

This isnt' necessarily a point of traveling with a baby, but having a 
baby certianly played a role in how we handled ourselves when we got back 
into the US. Unfortunately, our long layover in Chicago (to get back to
Madison) shrunk substantially when our flight from Paris was delayed. Until
we unloaded and made it through customs we had all but missed our flight
to Madison.  This left us with what felt like a lose-lose situation. We
could rely on American to get us home the next day with a 5 PM flight. They
kindly include a nights stay (at a hotel that might not have a shuttle) 
and a $12 meal voucher. Or we could spend $400 on a one-way rental car
from ORD to home and return it in Madison the next day. 

I think all of us just wanted to be home. At the end of the day, I didn't
feel like our time was worth it to just sit in another hotel room for
a day. As much as Grace and I wanted to be home, I think we both
really wanted to get Gwen home into familiar surroundings. With that,
we got the inorbinately expensive rental car and headed north. Yes,
this price was not fun, but in hindsight, I will still say it was
totally worth it. 

And for what it's worth, American refunded me $30 for all of this.

### sleep

I previously mentioned that we paid special attention to make sure that
each of the places that we were staying had a place for Gwen to sleep. 
For 6 beds in 2 weeks, I think she did a really good job sleeping
throughout the trip. Even when we arrived, she did surprisingly well
transitioning to the new time zone. She had slept for probably close
to 7 hours on the flight over and was able to fall asleep relatively
easily that night around 8 pm. She did wake up in the middle of the 
night for a little bit and that could easily have been her body
clock thinking that sleep was just a nap, but she eventually fell
back asleep and transitioned over just fine. 

We found that Gwen did a good job on night 2 and onward in each of 
her new environments as well. Transistions were generally challenging
for all of us and I think Gwen probably got messed up a little bit with
atypical days when we transitioned - lots of time in carseat or irregular
naps. 

#### ope
I did have one semi-major snaffu with nightly sleep. I must have messed
up when I made our reservations for a hotel in Nice by not specifying
that we actually needed a crib. I don't explicitly recall asking for
a crib, so I must have just seen that the place had cribs available 
and did nothing else with it. On arrival, they didn't have any more
cribs available. And the hotel concierge, a young guy, suggested that we
just have a bunch more blankets and pillows for Gwen. English wasn't
his first language, so it is hard to say if I misunderstood his
intentions. Regardless, we ended up with serveral more blankets and
pillows.

This is like don't do number 1 for children under a year. They should 
sleep in an environment with no blankets at all to keep them safe in 
their sleep. Knowing this, we put our engineering brains to work
and came up with a makeshift crib. We laid the hotel room desk on its
side so that the legs and top of the desk acted as 3 sides and the 
wall the 4th. To add a bit of cushion (but not too much), we put the
extra blankets in the bottom and pulled it taut using the weight of 
the desk.   

Gwen had a really rough time the first night we were there. To start,
she had fallen asleep in the car on the way down the mountain and 
the transition proved to be hard. Then this whole crib thing happened. 
After a few hours, she seemed to settle and slept for most of the
rest of the night. Thankfully, she did a really good job with this
less than ideal sleeping arangement for the rest of our time in Nice.

### navigating with your life on your back

I mentioned packing above. So how did it all work out? In short, 
most of the time, it went really well. It's worth noting that this
"carrying your life on your back" thing only happened during
transitions from one place to another. When we were put in a place 
for a few days, we could pick and choose what subset of stuff we
needed for an outing and pack a bag like it was any normal day 
back home. But this section focuses on those in between times.  
There's already some inherient stress that comes with moving from
place to place. Will I be on time for the plane or the train? Is
everything packed? Am I forgetting something? And for us with a
nine-month old, we have more than we're used to carrying while 
traveling, so it leaves us also wondering - what weird thing is 
going to happen because we have a ton of stuff?

The airplane was really 
smooth. There was plenty of overhead bin space for our carry-on
bags and Gwen having her own seat gave us a lot of space to fit
things under her seat. When we had a car, it was even easier. 
Both of these modes of transportation are also pretty familiar
to us. We've had some practice on plane and we get in a car with
Gwen every day.  

And then the "not most of the time" comes in. This isn't to say 
that things went horribly, but these were arenas that we just 
had not experienced before. We traveled on several trains during
the trip. This was certainly different for us. Trains are 
seemingly much less regulated from a "what you can take" standpoint
and it feels like the expectation of train travelers is not 
necessarily to be on vacation. This makes sense. I'm under the
impressions that utilizing trains for common eveeryday transit 
throughout Europe is much more common than what we do in the US. 
But that left us with a ton of stuff and not a lot of places to
put all of that stuff. There was space
for bikes on the trains, and we did use some of that space if
it was available. It just felt like we were setting someone else
up to not have space when we did that. And after getting everything
situated, there was the fear of getting it all back together when
we had to get off the train.

Lucky for us, we never needed to be in 
a huge rush when getting off the train because our stop was always
the end of the line. But I didn't exactly know that during our 
train rides, so I spent a good portion of time stressing about 
how I was going to collecting everything and get it off of the
train before it headed off for the next stop. 

We were fortunate on the train ride from Normandy back to Paris
that the conductor spotted us and allowed us to sit in the 
handicap area. This was incredible. We could keep everything in 
one place and more importantly, we didn't have to tear everything
down so we were a bit more mobile when it was time for us to get
off the train in Paris. Again, the train is not a normal mode
of transportation for us. And I was honestly really excited about
using the trains while we were on this trip. It was going to be
a nice time to look out the window and relax. In hindsight, I 
think the train travel was the most difficult part of our travels.
And I also don't know if we could have done much about it. We 
needed to have the things that we had. Maybe paying for a handicap
seat on every ride would have been beneficial, but I don't even
know if we would technically be allowed to buy such a seat.

Moving on, as an American traveling abroad and carrying your life
on your back and in a stroller, you come to notice why the Americans
with Disabilities Act exists.The ADA ensures that buildings and 
public spaces are accessible to people with disabilities, including 
providing ramps and elevators. This wasn't always the case throughout
our travels. 

At our hotel in Nice, there were stairs to get up to the elevator
from the reception desk. And then the elevator was so small that
the stroller wouldn't fit in the elevator. And the icing on the 
cake (aside from the no crib situation) was when we got into our room,
the stroller in the room made walkign around at all pretty hard.
I must say the consierge
at the hotel was really helpful in getting the stroller up
all of the stairs to our room.
I think it's probably safe to see see this sitaution as their
infrastructure is generally older and smaller than waht we have
in the US. This ultimately turned
out fine. We returned our stroller to the car the next morning to 
give ourselves some breathing room and enjoyed our day in Nice.
At the time, it felt like taking the stroller into the hotel was the
best thing for us. I think we envisioned using it to push Gwen around
the next day, but it was just too much in the room and it probably
would have been a pain to push around all day too. We encountered plenty
of cobblestone sidewalks, stairs, and crowded streets. 

When we got to Paris, we felt the stroller pain more acutely. It was not
uncommon to encounter many stairs when getting in an out of the subway
with no elevators. In these cases, I would take all of the bags out 
of the stroller and transport them to the top or bottom of the stairs and 
then I'd come back up and we'd carry the stroller (with Gwen in it) 
down the stairs. This wasn't terrible, but it feels like you stick out
like a sore thumb. Some people in the subway went out of their way to
help us out. In a somewhat stressful moment, this was really appreciated. 
As we kept doing this throughout the trip, I feel comfortable saying
that we got better at it and it was less stressful. But at first, it 
felt almost debilitating. I was certainly not expecting this wrinkle 
at all. 

### sustaining a nine-month old while on the go

One thing about having a baby that has been surprising to me is
how much I used to take eating, sleeping, and going to the
bathroom for granted. If I was 
hungry, I ate some food. If I was tired, I either went to bed, 
got another cup of coffee or took a nap (on the weekend). If I 
need to go to the bathroom, I went to the bathroom. That
level of flexibility just doesn't exist for a baby. They need to
eat and sleep as part of a routine. And getting them out of the 
routine can mean a nightmare for mom and dad. Before going further,
Gwen has been a really flexible baby for us. She can handle some
variance with limited impact. But while you're traveling, there
is more than just a little variance. You're out and about with 
places to see and it's more than a little inconvienent to have
to go back to the hotel room for Gwen to eat and sleep. 

We didn't let this be a hinderance to use throughout the trip.
I think we maintained a nice balance of 
longer days away from where we were staying and short expeditions
that were close by. For food, Gwen was at a really good age. We
were fortunate that she was still breastfeeding but also eating
a good amount of solids - enough to know that we didn't have to
worry about any allergies. When out and about for a day, we 
typically had snacks packed for her. On a few occassions, we did
need to find a conviencence store or market of sorts to get her
a snack. There seemed to be a lot less 7-Eleven in France. 
Specifically in Paris, we opted into an empty Catholic church
for her to nurse and get changed. The church feels welcoming, so 
I generally felt more comfortable than when sitting down on the 
street somewhere. You can sit in awe of the Church and prayer rather than 
feeling like people are staring at you.

When leaving where we were staying for a 
longer day, we always had the baby carrier so that Grace 
or I (mostly Grace) could wear 
Gwen. I'll contend that the carrier may be the most important thing
we packed for the trip and we likely didn't know how much we 
needed it. Gwen was a champion in it during days of walking around
cities or even going for a long hike. When she seemed to get tired,
Grace could turn her to face inwards and she took phenomenal naps.
During these long days, we also ran into the fact that Gwen couldn't
just always be in the carrier. There were a few points where she 
needed to get out but it meant her crawling around on something
less than ideal. It wasn't all bad. We did find a park while in Nice
that had a turflike surface that Gwen could easily crawl around on. 
On days with short trips out from where we were staying it was nice
for Gwen to be able to sleep in a crib, so that it wasn't always chaos.

The bathroom situation is slightly different than food and sleep
but it's still an important part of taking care of a little one. It 
feels commonplace to me that in the US there are changing tables 
in nearly all pubic restrooms. This wasn't necessarily the case in
France. Part of that is the fact that public restrooms aren't nearly
as common. But even in those restrooms, I didn't often notice a 
changing table. We ultimately changed Gwen in many places and it 
turned out fine. It just took a bit of getting used to that this
would be atypical by our standards. 

## how did it go for mom & dad?

Going into the trip, I was cautiously optimistic about everything.
We had a plan for a roof over our head every night and a means
to get to that roof over our head. I was also nervous about
the travel, being in a foreign place, and reverting to sleeping
in the same room as Gwen for our hotel nights. 

After the fact, I'm happy. I'm grateful that we were able to
take advantage of this unique opportunity. And though I didn't 
envision we'd travel to a foreign country with a nine-month old 
when I started at Epic 5 years ago, I'm so glad we did. There
were certainly difficult times during the trip where Gwen
was going through a rough patch. But there were also so many
more joyful times. On returnign, I've told many people that we had
a great trip and I think that is truly a testament to Gwen. 
Her flexibility allowed us to experience everything we had
hoped for.
