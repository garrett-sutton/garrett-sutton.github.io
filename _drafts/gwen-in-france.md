This post is largely going to sound like a Gwen appreciation
rather than a post on how to travel with a nine-month old.But
I do hope to highlight what it was like along the way.

## Preparation

### Could we do this?

We had been talking about going to France well before Gwen.
So when Gwen came into the picture, Grace would only continue
entertaining the conversation if Gwen was included in the trip.
I was admittedly a bit worried. I had never left the North 
American continent and now I was going to go to a foreign
country where English wasn't the primary language with a
nine-month old. 

### Gaining some confidence

We used our Christmas time 2023 travels as a trial run for
traveling with an infant. On that trip, we flew out of Milwaukee
to NY to spend time with Grace's family for Christmas and finished
off the trip with a friend's wedding in Georgia. This was a good
taste of how things would go for our trip. It had several 
transitions during the trip and gave us the opportunity to figure
out what it was like to carry our lives on our backs. In theory,
Gwen would also be more flexible for our trip to France since
she would be 6 months older. After this Christmas 2023 trip,
I think we were both tired but we had fun and didn't feel like
it was ridiculous to move forward with planning for France. 

We talked with Gwen's doctor about the trip and heard any any 
specific health considerations we shoudl take into account for
the trip. The big things that stand out to me were making sure
she was up-to-date on a few vaccines and that she had her own 
seat on the plane. The extra $1,000+ for a baby seat is tough
to stomach, but at the same time, one of us having to hold Gwen
for the duration of a transatlantic flight was going to be 
hard and likely unsafe if we wanted to sleep at all. 

### Planning

For actual trip planning, I pretty much planned to do most 
all of the big things that I think we would have done even
if Gwen wasn't around. We were going to the Tour de France, going to
the Olympics, spending time in a town in the Alps, and planning
to see some of the Normany region. When booking places to stay, I paid 
special attention to whether the place had a crib or pack'n'play
available for Gwen to sleep in. And with each stop along the way,
we tried to think of all of the Gwen things that we needed to
deal with so that things went smoothly. For example, we ran into
the unfornutate scenario that Gwen needed her own tickets to the
Olympics.    

### Packing

We were intentional about how our packing was giong to impact our
lives when on the ground. We had several transitions to account for
and different modes of tranportation along the way. I felt that the 
biggest factor in making our lives as easy as possible was to just
limit the amount of stuff that we had. Just because we were allowed
to fit things on a plane didn't mean that we shoudl try to maximize
what we were going to take. In my experience, the plane has typically
been the packing bottleneck. But for us, the real bottleneck was going
to be that we had some real miles to put on while carrying everything.

We would have had to pay an inordinate amount for a checked bag, but it 
wasn't going to be feasible to have a large checked back that we
needed to roller through cobblestone streets as we were transitioning 
between places anyway. We did bring our big Graco stroller and that was 
truly
helpful. One of us coudl carry and roll what was reasonable. Then most everything else could fit either one the others back or under the 
stroller.  

All total, we brought:
- Stroller
- Car seat
- Diaper bag
- Grace carry-on
- Garrett carry-on
- Gwen carry-on (a 50L hiking backpack)
- Grace personal item (a 20L daypack)

This is still a lot of stuff but we still came in a bit under what we were
"allowed" (i.e. Gwen and I didn't technically have a "personal item"). 

We tried to pack versatile clothes. And with it being summer time we didn't
need to worry too much. A few extra layers were helpful 
though. Knowing that 2 weeks of clothes is a lot, we were cognizant of the 
fact that we needed to do laundry. We were forunate the the one place
we stayed that had laundry (i.e. in the airBnb in the Alps) was right
in the middle of the trip. 

TODO: consider mentioning what we left behind and other things of what
we brought. Feels helpful to call out that we could buy things along the
way and that we didn't need to have EVERYTHIGN

## In action

### Bassinets are not real

During our preparation, we found various blogs and even the American
Airlines website mentioning of bassinets that could be used for
free on a first-come-first-serve basis. We figured this would be really
nice for Gwen to sleep comfortably and have a little bit more space 
than her car seat. 

I talked with folks from
American at an airport on a previous trip to try to get some insight
on how the whole bassinet thing worked. The answer that I consistently
got was that I would have to talk with people at the airport on the day
of travel. On arriving at the Madison airport, Grace went to the 
baggage counter to have that conversation and the attendant looked at
her like she had 3 heads. Grace was told we would have to wait to talk
to the gate agent in Philadelphia (right before the flight across the
pond). Talk about making us wait until the last minute. In all of the 
conversations Grace and I had and blogs that I read, no one every really
seemed to indicate much doubt in our ability to get a bassinet. Without
knowing any better, we figured this was just the process. 

So when we arrived at the gate in Philadelphia and the gate agents pretty 
bluntly said that we can't get a bassinet, I was a bit taken back. They
kept saying that you needed to be in the bulk head seat (which seemingly
we were not). Once we found out what the bulk head seat actually was, 
it became clear that this whole bassinet thing is not nearly as
accomodating as the American Airlines website made it out to be. When 
you book an international flight, you need to know beforehand what row
sits behind the bulk head. Yes - this means you need to know what model
of plane you'll be flying on. If and only if that row is available, you'll
have a chance of getting a bassinet. For us, we were SOL for this trip.
We were back in economy and Gwen was going to ahve to make due in 
her carseeat. 

After finding this out but prior to boarding, we were pretty nervous.
But those nerves never manifest into any real problems. Gwen took a 
little while to fall asleep that night as we got on our way from
Philly, but after she fell asleep, she stayed alseep for almost the 
entire flight to Nice. Luckily, Grace and I were able to get some 
rest too (as good as one can on an airplane that is).

Continuing on the topic of flying, Gwen also did really really well on
the way home too. This flight left Paris in the late afternoon and arrived 
in Chicago in the early evening. Again, Gwen slept for a good portion of 
the flight and was pretty content for most of the time that she was awake.
She was a very good baby. On coming home, this is one of the biggest 
pieces that people talk with us about and I can confidently say it
went about as smooth as you could possibly imagine.

### we just want to be home

This isnt' necessarily a point of traveling with a baby, but having a 
baby certianly played a role in how we handled ourselves when we got back 
into the US. Unfortunately, our long layover in Chicago (to get back to
Madison) shrunk substantially when our flight from Paris was delayed. Until
we unloaded and made it through customs we had all but missed our flight
to Madison.  This left us with what felt like a lose-lose situation. We
could rely on American to get us home the next day with a 5 PM flight. They
kindly include a nights stay (at a hotel that might not have a shuttle) 
and a $12 meal voucher. Or we could spend $400 on a one-way rental car
from ORD to home and return it in Madison the next day. 

I think all of us just wanted to be home. At the end of the day, I didn't
feel like our time was worth it to just sit in another hotel room for
a day. As much as Grace and I wanted to be home, I think we both
really wanted to get Gwen home into familiar surroundings. With that,
we got the inorbinately expensive rental car and headed north. Yes,
this price was not fun, but in hindsight, I will still say it was
totally worth it. 

And for what it's worth, American refunded me $30 for all of this.

   - bassinet on the plane
   - navigating Paris. Just hte stroller dilema
   - logistics of Gwen eating and sleeping (at the tour especially)
- talk about the things that went suprisingly well
   - her sleeping on the plane
