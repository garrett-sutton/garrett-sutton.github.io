This post is largely going to sound like a Gwen appreciation
rather than a post on how to travel with a nine-month old.But
I do hope to highlight what it was like along the way.

## Planning
We had been talking about going to France well before Gwen.
So when Gwen came into the picture, Grace would only continue
entertaining the conversation if Gwen was included in the trip.
I was admittedly a bit worried. I had never left the North 
American continent and now I was going to go to a foreign
country where English wasn't the primary language with a
nine-month old. 

We used our Christmas time 2023 travels as a trial run for
traveling with an infant. On that trip, we flew out of Milwaukee
to NY to spend time with Grace's family for Christmas and finished
off the trip with a friend's wedding in Georgia. This was a good
taste of how things would go for our trip. It had several 
transitions during the trip and gave us the opportunity to figure
out what it was like to carry our lives on our backs. In theory,
Gwen would also be more flexible for our trip to France since
she would be 6 months older. After this Christmas 2023 trip,
I think we were both tired but we had fun and didn't feel like
it was ridiculous to move forward with planning for France. 

We talked with Gwen's doctor about the trip and heard any any 
specific health considerations we shoudl take into account for
the trip. The big things that stand out to me were making sure
she was up-to-date on a few vaccines and that she had her own 
seat on the plane. The extra $1,000+ for a baby seat is tough
to stomach, but at the same time, one of us having to hold Gwen
for the duration of a transatlantic flight was going to be 
hard and likely unsafe if we wanted to sleep at all. 

For actual trip planning, I pretty much planned to do most 
all of the big things that I think we would have done even
if Gwen wasn't around. We were going to the Tour de France, going to
the Olympics, spending time in a town in the Alps, and planning
to see some of the Normany region. When booking places to stay, I paid 
special attention to whether the place had a crib or pack'n'play
available for Gwen to sleep in. And with each stop along the way,
we tried to think of all of the Gwen things that we needed to
deal with so that things went smoothly. For example, we ran into
the unfornutate scenario that Gwen needed her own tickets to the
Olympics.    

It was a bit of a bummer, but I did have to buy Gwen her own 
Olympics tickets.
