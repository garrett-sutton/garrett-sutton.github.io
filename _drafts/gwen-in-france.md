This post is largely going to sound like a Gwen appreciation
rather than a post on how to travel with a nine-month old.But
I do hope to highlight what it was like along the way.

## Preparation

### Could we do this?

We had been talking about going to France well before Gwen.
So when Gwen came into the picture, Grace would only continue
entertaining the conversation if Gwen was included in the trip.
I was admittedly a bit worried. I had never left the North 
American continent and now I was going to go to a foreign
country where English wasn't the primary language with a
nine-month old. 

### Gaining some confidence

We used our Christmas time 2023 travels as a trial run for
traveling with an infant. On that trip, we flew out of Milwaukee
to NY to spend time with Grace's family for Christmas and finished
off the trip with a friend's wedding in Georgia. This was a good
taste of how things would go for our trip. It had several 
transitions during the trip and gave us the opportunity to figure
out what it was like to carry our lives on our backs. In theory,
Gwen would also be more flexible for our trip to France since
she would be 6 months older. After this Christmas 2023 trip,
I think we were both tired but we had fun and didn't feel like
it was ridiculous to move forward with planning for France. 

We talked with Gwen's doctor about the trip and heard any any 
specific health considerations we shoudl take into account for
the trip. The big things that stand out to me were making sure
she was up-to-date on a few vaccines and that she had her own 
seat on the plane. The extra $1,000+ for a baby seat is tough
to stomach, but at the same time, one of us having to hold Gwen
for the duration of a transatlantic flight was going to be 
hard and likely unsafe if we wanted to sleep at all. 

### Planning

For actual trip planning, I pretty much planned to do most 
all of the big things that I think we would have done even
if Gwen wasn't around. We were going to the Tour de France, going to
the Olympics, spending time in a town in the Alps, and planning
to see some of the Normany region. When booking places to stay, I paid 
special attention to whether the place had a crib or pack'n'play
available for Gwen to sleep in. And with each stop along the way,
we tried to think of all of the Gwen things that we needed to
deal with so that things went smoothly. For example, we ran into
the unfornutate scenario that Gwen needed her own tickets to the
Olympics.    

### Packing

We were intentional about how our packing was giong to impact our
lives when on the ground. We had several transitions to account for
and different modes of tranportation along the way. I felt that the 
biggest factor in making our lives as easy as possible was to just
limit the amount of stuff that we had. Just because we were allowed
to fit things on a plane didn't mean that we shoudl try to maximize
what we were going to take. In my experience, the plane has typically
been the packing bottleneck. But for us, the real bottleneck was going
to be that we had some real miles to put on while carrying everything.

We would have had to pay an inordinate amount for a checked bag, but it 
wasn't going to be feasible to have a large checked back that we
needed to roller through cobblestone streets as we were transitioning 
between places anyway. We did bring our big Graco stroller and that was 
truly
helpful. One of us coudl carry and roll what was reasonable. Then most everything else could fit either one the others back or under the 
stroller.  

All total, we brought:
- Stroller
- Car seat
- Diaper bag
- Grace carry-on
- Garrett carry-on
- Gwen carry-on (a 50L hiking backpack)
- Grace personal item (a 20L daypack)

This is still a lot of stuff but we still came in a bit under what we were
"allowed" (i.e. Gwen and I didn't technically have a "personal item"). 

We tried to pack versatile clothes. And with it being summer time we didn't
need to worry too much. A few extra layers were helpful 
though. Knowing that 2 weeks of clothes is a lot, we were cognizant of the 
fact that we needed to do laundry. We were forunate the the one place
we stayed that had laundry (i.e. in the airBnb in the Alps) was right
in the middle of the trip. 

## On the ground


## Challenges

## what we wish we knew
- packnplay in Nice
- talk about how some things didn't end up looking as I expected
   - trains were not super fun 
   - bassinet on the plane
   - navigating Paris. Just hte stroller dilema
   - logistics of Gwen eating and sleeping (at the tour especially)
- talk about the things that went suprisingly well
   - her sleeping on the plane
