The last stop on our journey through France in summer
2024 was a day trip to the Normandy region. In our 
initial planning for the trip, we weren't sure if this
would fit. But when we found that we had a day, it 
felt important to make an effort to go to an area that
is so important to not just American history but also
world history. And bonus, it was only a 2-hour train 
ride from Paris.

Note that Normandy is not a town. Forever, I had thought
the "beaches of Normandy" meant there were 5 beaches
in this single French town. The reality is that 
Normandy is a region, much more similar to a county in
the states. 

## the sights 

We rode a train from Paris to the town of Caen. From what
I can tell, Caen is one of the bigger towns in the 
region and it sits a few miles inland from the English 
Channel. This area of France is drastically different 
from the magnificent Alps that we saw in the southeast. 
It looks remarkably quaint and resembles the rural 
midwest - small towns and farmlands for as far as the
eye can see. Caen, interestingly, has a lot of history
before World War 2. There is a large castle and
a notably old church in the town as well. There was a 
small square that we found in Caen with a bunch of 
restaurants. Here, we sat outside, had one of the 
nicest meals of the trip, and took in the quintessential
small French town vibe. This year was the 80th anniversary
of the D-Day landings. There were also a bunch of small
national flags hanging throughout the square in memory
of those nations that played pivotal roles in the success
of Operation Overlord. This only added to the ambiance. 

### Memorial de Caen

Later on, we went to a World War 2 museum in Caen (Memorial
de Caen). This museum was very moving. First, the imagery
of the entrance was remarkable. You walked into this 
dark room that had a spiral ramp down to a lower level. 
The entire time, you could hear a speech from Hitler echoing
up from the lower level, and there was a timeline starting
from the end of World War 1 that illustrated Hitler's rise
to power and ending with the start of World War 2. It 
made you feel like the world was spiraling out
of control. 

Moving forward, the museum gave an in-depth look into the
timeline of events of World War 2. I found it interesting
that they were sure to highlight that France pretty much
rolled over to Hitler. It even called out that the French
leader at the time felt that aligning with Hitler would
increase his chances of accomplishing his political
agenda. It's a scary reality that though nations as a 
whole go to war, the fate of those nations can be held in the 
hands of a small number of individuals or a even single 
individual. 

Next, I had a thought-provoking
conversation while making my way through the museum. As 
Gwen did for much of the trip, she got attention from a 
stranger who subsequently asked me where we were from. After
saying the US, he promptly stated "You know you guys are the
reason we have a free Europe today, otherwise we'd all be 
speaking German." I was sort of shocked and felt that there
was simply no way I could have responded in a way that met
the moment. I perceived this as a statement of 
thank you for US generations past. And coming from a 
Frenchman, it meant something to me. The French are 
stereotypically rude, but not this guy. He went out of his
way to acknowledge the US in a way that I may not even
fully appreciate. I've had the great blessing of growing
up in the United States of America where I'm normalized to
freedom. Generations before me have made great sacrifices
for the safety and prosperity of this great country and
of the whole world. This great sacrifice is summed up by 
the message in the garden for the American armed forces 
at this museum: _From the heart of our land flows the 
blood of our youth given to you in the name of freedom._
I think it's important that we - 
as a nation and as citizens of this nation - 
recognize the good that the United States has promoted and 
continues to promote throughout the entire world and
the responsibility that comes with it.

### Airborne Museum

While in Normandy, we found there was an airborne museum 
that was dedicated to the US paratroopers who jumped
on the night before D-Day. I wanted to go to this museum
for 2 reasons. We watched Band of Brothers - the show about
the 101st Airborne. And this feels like an overlooked part
of the D-Day landings. 

This museum was pretty cool. They had a few separate 
buildings and each one had a different focus. One focused
on the French people's resistance to the German occupation.
Another emphasized the planes used to deliver the 
paratroopers the night before the land invasion. There was
also a building on the technology used by each soldier when
jumping and after they landed. And finally, there was a 
building exhibiting the entire Overlord operation. 

Being able to put some of the things shown in the Band
of Brothers show into context made this museum a worthwhile
stop. Had we not been in a hurry to check off other boxes,
I'm sure we could have spent even more time here.

### Dick Winters Memorial

While out in this area, we also found the Dick Winters
memorial. He is one of the men that is highlighted throughout
the Band of Brothers show. I found his quote on the memorial
to be one worth sharing. _Wars do not make men great, but
they do bring out the greatness in good men._ Humbling, to
say the least. The men who led the way on D-Day are 
truly incredible. 

### Utah Beach

Utah Beach sits the furthest to the west of all of the
landing beaches. Along with Omaha Beach, this is an
exclusively American landing beach. By the time we
got here, we were in a bit of a rush and decided to not
get out of the car. We were able to drive along the
beach road for a little bit and could ultimately only 
see the dunes because they were big enough to block
any view of the water. There was a museum of sorts
here and several flags around a memorial.


### Pointe du Hoc

Pointe du Hoc is an area between Utah Beach and Omaha Beach
where US Army rangers scaled these 90-foot cliffs to
overtake heavily fortified German soldiers. Though 
rushed, we did get out of the car for this and took 
a little walk out to the area near the bunkers and cliffs.

Walking through this area left me with a strange feeling. 
On the one hand, you can look up and down the coast at these 
enormous cliffs and appreciate the courage of those American
soldiers who triumphed here 80 years ago. On the other hand,
we could walk down into the German bunkers. Getting 
into these bunkers made me appreciate the bravery of the
American soldiers that much more, but at the same time, it
was eerie to walk on the same ground where the Germans
would have been staked out. On that same ground, blood was
certainly shed. It's a somber feeling knowing that my
own feet were sharing the same floor as those who did
true evil 80 years ago.  

### Omaha Beach

By the time we made it to Omaha Beach, it was getting to 
be pretty close to time for us to head back to Caen to get
our train that evening. Given the time crunch, we didn't
have time to get out of the car and take in the 
scene. Grace and Gwen got out of the car to get a quick
reset while I turned around at a point, but no prolonged 
walk. There weren't large dunes like there were
at Utah Beach, so you could see where sand meets 
water. 

Let me set the scene.
You drive down a road with a few campsites to get to a road
that parallels that coastline. The road has some restaurants
and feels pretty normal. And then the beach was populated 
with a lot of people having a beach day. I was sort of 
surprised by this easygoingness on what I would have thought
of as hallowed ground. Seemingly it's been normalized by 
the locals. I just don't think I could feel comfortable 
going for a beach day in a place where so much life was
lost. I should point out that I don't mean to judge the French 
people as disrespectful here. There were more American flags throughout
the Normandy region than I typically see at home. They were 
everywhere - businesses, houses, barns, city streets. I also 
would have to think that spending time on this beach for the
locals is potentially a bit of closure about the war. I'm sure
that folks would have used this beach for fun before the war
and by continuing to use the beach for fun they have maybe 
been able to move on from the devastating times of WW2. 

You may be thinking, what about the American cemetery? For 
months leading up to the trip, we had every intention of 
going to the American cemetery which is close to Omaha 
Beach. Unfortunately, in the rush of getting through
everything and heading back to Caen for our train, I 
completely forgot about it. In hindsight, I don't think 
we had time for it, but I simply forgot.  

## the feelings

While in the Normandy region, I think I was expecting to 
walk around with goosebumps for hours on end. The reality
was much different. Each piece of history that we saw had
its own significance and evoked its own feelings. But the
key point of that is that it is a piece of history. The 
current state of the Normandy region looks a lot like rural areas of the United
States - farmland, small towns, small roads, etc. And
given that "familiarity" it's honestly difficult to imagine
what life in this region of the world would have been like
around the time of June 6, 1944. The region pays homage
to the entire war effort and respects the amount 
of allied support they received during those difficult times. 
But as a visitor who was there for only a day, I'd be
lying if I said this was the most moving experience of 
my life. And I think you could get even more out
of it by:
1. Doing a lot of research. I read 
[Engineers of Victory]({% link _posts/2024-5-26-engineers-of-victory.md %}) in
the months leading up to our trip and watched Band of Brothers
but of course, more context on the situation could never be
a bad thing.  
1. Hiring a tour guide. We went back and forth on doing this 
and ultimately decided against it because we wanted the 
freedom to do as we wished with Gwen being so little. It felt
like we could have gotten into a pickle if she was having a 
bad day and we were on everyone else's time. However, in 
hindsight, this would have been beneficial. I think 
that someone worth their salt helps a ton with #1 above but
also has a much better idea of how long to spend at the 
various sights. I can't overstate how many memorials are in
this area. It was a bit overwhelming to pick the ones that
we did.
1. Spending more time. I ultimately think the pieces above
could be limited if we had more time while we were in the
region. It was unfortunate that by the time we got even to 
Utah Beach we felt like we had to do drive-bys for 
everything. Museums make this sort of thing especially 
difficult. They are the epitome of you get out what you 
put in. To pay respect to the American soldiers
who fought so bravely on this land, I felt like I had to 
care a lot about the content of the museums. But with limited
time, this quickly ate into time that we could have spent
at other sights. 
 
With all of this being said, I think that any
American who has the opportunity to visit this region
definitely should. Even in the short time we had, I can 
confidently say this experience deepened my appreciation 
of D-Day as a pivotal moment in shaping the world's 
future for the better.
