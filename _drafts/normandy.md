The last stop on our journey through France in summer
2024 was a day trip to the Normandy region. In our 
initial planning for the trip we weren't sure if this
would fit. But when we found that we had a day, it 
felt important to make an effort to go to an area that
is so important to not just American history but also
world history. And bonus, it was only a 2 hour train 
ride from Paris.

Note that Normandy is not a town. Forever, I had thought
the "beaches of Normandy" meant there were 5 beaches
in this single French town. The reality is that 
Normandy is a region, much more similar to a county in
the states. 

## the sights 

We rode a train from Paris to the town of Caen. From what
I can tell, Caen is one of the bigger towns in the 
region and it sits a few miles inland from the English 
Channel. This area of France is drastically differnt 
from the magnificent Alps that we saw in the south east. 
It looks remarkably quaint and resembles the rural 
midwest - small towns and farmlands for as far as the
eye can see. Caen, interestingly, has a lot of history
too it prior to World War 2. There is a large castle and
a notably old church in the town as well. There was a 
small square that we found in Caen with a bunch of 
restaurants. Here, we sat outside, had one of the 
nicest meals of the trip, and took in the quintessential
small French town vibe. This year was the 80th anniversary
of the D-Day landings. There were also a bunch of small
national flags hanging throughout the square in memory
of those nations that played pivotal roles in the success
of Operation Overlord. This only added to the ambiance. 

### Memorial de Caen

Later on, we went to a World War 2 museum in Caen (Memorial
de Caen). This museum was very moving. First, the imagery
of the enterance was remarkable. You walked into this 
dark room that had a spiral ramp down to a lower level. 
The entire time, you could hear a speech from Hitler echoing
up from the lower level, and there was a timeline starting
from the end of World War 1 that illustrated Hitler's rise
to power and ending with the start of World War 2. It 
literally made you feel like the world was spiraling out
of control. 

Moving forward, the museum gave an in-depth look into the
timeline of events of World War 2. I found it interesting
that they were sure to highlight that France pretty much
rolled over to Hitler. It even called out that the French
leader at the time felt that aligning with Hitler would
increase his chances of accomplishing his personal political
agenda. It's a scary reality that though nations as a 
whole go to war, the fate of those nations can be held in the 
hands of a small numbers of individuals or a even single 
individual. 

Next, I had a thought provoking
conversation while making my way through the museum. As 
Gwen did for much of the trip, she got attention from a 
stranger who subsequently asked me where we were from. After
saying the US, he promptly stated "You know you guys are the
reason we have a free Europe today, otherwise we'd all be 
speaking German." I was sort of shocked and feel that there
is simply no way I could have responded in a way that met
the moment. I perceived this as a statement of 
thank you for US generations past. And coming from a 
Frenchman, it meant something to me. The French are 
stereotypically rude, but not this guy. He went out of his
way to acknowledge the US in a way that I may not even
fully appreciate. I've had the great blessing of growing
up in a United States of America where I'm normalized to
freedom. Generations prior to me have made great sacrifices
for the safety and prosperity of this great country and
of the whole world. This great sacrifice is summed up by 
the message at the garden for the American armed forces 
at this museum: _From the heart of our land flows the 
blood of our youth given to you in the name of freedom._
I think it's important that we - 
as a nation and as citizens of this nation - 
recognize the good that the United States has promoted and 
continues to promote throughout the entire world and
the responsibility that comes with it.

### Airborne Museum

While in Normandy, we found there was an airborne museum 
that was dedicated to the US paratroopers that jumped
on the night before D-Day. I wanted to go to this musuem
for 2 reasons. We watched Band of Brothers - the show about
the 101st Airbone. And this feels like an overlooked part
of the D-Day landings. 

This museum was pretty cool. They had a few separate 
buildings where each one had a different focus. One was 
on the French people's resistance to the German occupation.
Another focused solely on the planes used to deliver the 
paratroopers hte night before the land invasion. There was
also a building on the technology used by each soldier when
jumping and after they landed. And finally, there was a 
building exhibiting the entire Overlord operation. 

Being able to put some of the things shown in the Band
of Brothers show into context made this museum a worthwhile
stop. Had we not been in a hurry to check off other boxes,
I'm sure we coudl have spent even more time here.

### Utah Beach

Utah Beach sits the furthest to the west of all of the
landing beaches.
