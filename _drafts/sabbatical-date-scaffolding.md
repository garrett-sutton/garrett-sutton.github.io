## Purpose
To make it easy to find out sabbatical date plana at a high level

## Travel to France
Sabbatical starts on Wednesday July 17, 2024. Plan 
to fly into Nice, France. This will likely be an overnight red-eye that leaves Madison in the afternoon on the 17th and arrives in Nice around 11 am. 

## Tour de France
After arriving in France on the 18th, we'd want to see the last 3 stages of the Tour de France in and around the Nice area. These stages are

- Friday July 19
- Saturday July 20
- Sunday July 21

## Staying in the Alps
After the conclusion of the Tour, we plan to head out into the mountains for a few days (place TBD). We'll need to determine where we want to go and what time we expect the Tour on Sunday to end in order to determine where to stay on Sunday July 21 into Monday July 22. 
From there on, we'll likely stay in an airbnb. Relevant dates to look for (by night):

- Sunday July 21 (TBD)
- Monday July 22
- Tuesday July 23
- Wednesday July 24
- Thursday July 25

On Friday, July 26 we will want to make our way to Paris.

## Paris
We want to see a few Olympic events while in Paris and maybe some other sites too. As of 12/2023, we have tickets to events on:
- Saturday July 27 (Rowing)
- Sunday July 28 (Beach Volleyball)

Given the event dates, I expect we'll need to have lodging in Paris for (at least):
- Friday July 26
- Saturday July 27
- Sunday July 28


## Getting home
Sabbatical technically ends Tuesday July 30. This
means that's I would have to go back to work on Wednesday July 31. 
There is an open question with this post as to whether there are things that we might want to see (Olympics or otherwise) on:
- Monday July 29
- Tuesday July 30
- Wednesday July 31
- Thursday August 1
- Friday August 2

If we determine there are things we'd like to see or do during that time, I could take additional vacation time.
