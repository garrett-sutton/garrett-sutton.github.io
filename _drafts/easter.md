For Easter 2024, we packed up the car for a road trip to
Pennsylvania and Maryland. We'd spend the majority of 
the trip with my family in Pennsylvania but were going 
to make a quick trip to my sister-in-law's in the greater
Baltimore/D.C. area for a day too. This was a new 
travel experience for us and for Gwen. And Gwen was going
to get to meet a bunch of new people!

## Trip details
We left for PA on the day before Palm Sunday and arrived
late that night. We had a fairly relaxing day on Sunday
before heading to my sister-in-laws on Monday. The 3 
hour car ride was nothing compared to what we did on 
Saturday. It's a beautiful drive too. I'm happy we got
to do it in the light. We only stayed at Maddie and 
Connor's for a day, so we piled back in the car after
dinner on Tuesday and arrived back at my parents late
on Tuesday night.

After getting back to my parents, we were pretty much
stationary. I feel like we were largely able to 
enjoy some nice spring-like weather and find some solace
from the constant go-go of the everyday routine back
home - even with a neverending stream of people coming 
to see us. We also made it to Good Friday liturgy at 
Saint Michael's which might be the first time since 
graduating college and starting work that I've gone.
We went back to Saint Michael's for mass on Easter 
Sunday. Then, on Monday, we made the long drive back
home to Wisconsin.

we got to see.
