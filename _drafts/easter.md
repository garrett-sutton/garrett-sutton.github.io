For Easter 2024, we packed up the car for a road trip to
Pennsylvania and Maryland. We'd spend the majority of 
the trip with my family in Pennsylvania but were going 
to make a quick trip to my sister-in-law's in the greater
Baltimore/D.C. area for a day too. This was a new 
travel experience for us and for Gwen. And Gwen was going
to get to meet a bunch of new people!

## Travel details
- Saturday: Drive to my parents in PA (approx 12.5 hours 
total with ~10.5 hours of driving)
- Monday:   Drive to my sister-in-laws outside of 
Baltimore, MD (approx 3 hours from my parents)
- Tuesday: Drive back to my parents in the evening
- Monday:  Drive back home (~13 hours total)

## Traveling with a six month old
Driving for long stretches with a six month old was 
obviously new for Grace and I. We wanted to make sure
we were taking care of Gwen appropriately while also
making decent progress. This was especially relevent
for the long stretches to/from Wi-Pa. Luckily, the 
bulk of the drive is on I80/I90 where there are 
plenty of good rest stops. We did some research 
to find rest stops that were approximately 2.5-3 
hours apart and planned to hit those. Once there, 
we could do the normal rest stop things, get Gwen
changed and have her eat.

The night before we left, Gwen had her worst night 
of sleep she had in a while. She was up almost 
every hour and Grace was handling her for the most
part so that I could get some rest for the drive. 
By around 4:30 AM, I got up to try to help out and
brought Gwen to our bed with the intention that
she likely wasn't going to fall asleep and we'd be on
the road within the hour. Probably for the better,
we all fell back asleep for a few hours and didn't get
on the road until 8 AM. Normally, I'd be a bit antsy
about leaving this late, but it was really nice
to get the extra sleep.

On the way to PA, we may have pushed it a little bit
at the start. However, we felt that it was 
unnecessary to stop before Chicago (~2 hours way) and we didn't 
want to stop in Chicago. That left us pushing into 
Indiana. I knew the first rest stop in Indiana wasn't
all that nice, so the plan was to make it ~50 miles
into Indiana where the rest stop would have adequate seating
and be a nice spot for Grace to feed Gwen. We stuck to this
plan even though Gwen woke up upset from a morning nap as we
were making our way through Chicago. Grace went back to
console her, only to find a smelly baby. With nowhere in the
area that we really wanted to stop, we pushed on. Somehow,
Gwen managed to fall back asleep too. We made it to target
rest stop #1. Grace took Gwen in to get changed and started
on eating while I got gas and went to the bathroom. Even
with doing this stuff, I ended up sitting in the rest stop
for a while before Grace and Gwen came out of the bathroom. 
I even went so far as texting Grace to make sure things
were alright. Things were fine, just very poopy. In total,
this stop took an hour. An ominous sign for the rest of
the trip. 

The rest of the trip went smooth though. Gwen slept a good
but not too much amount. Otherwise, she 
did good for most of the ride and only seemed to 
get fussy as we were getting within the last 30ish minutes
of each leg of the journey. Grace was able to hop into 
the back seat with her during those times to calm her
down some.

With our newfound driving with a baby expertise, we did the
3 hour PA-MD trip in one stretch. This worked about the same
as the trip to PA. Grace fed Gwen right before we left each 
time and then Gwen slept for most of the trip. Smooth sailing!

On the ride home from PA, I think we stopped at all of the same
rest stops. I think our stops were quicker than the east bound
trip even though the trip as a whole seemed to take a bit longer. 
The only additional thing worth noting here is that Gwen slept 
for a ton of the trip back. I think this was likely coupled with
a week+ of poor sleep (more on that later). 

All in all, I think our car travels with Gwen went really well. 
We weren't sure what to expect, but the flexibility of driving
and the loose planning on where to stop along the way helped a 
lot. We had a few toys and things Gwen could look at on the 
drive, but as a 6 month old, we didn't actually need to do that 
much to keep her entertained. Grace and music filled in the times
when she seemed to get bored. Couple all of this with Gwen being 3 
months older than she was when we traveled over Christmas, and she was 
much easier this time around too. 

## Family and friends
conceptualize and give "credit" to all of the people that
we got to see.
