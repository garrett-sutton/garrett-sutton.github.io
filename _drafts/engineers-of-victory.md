## Why did I start it?
With our upcomming trip to France, I've been
trying to make an effort to learn what I 
wasn't taught or have just forgotten since
taking 20th Century history in high school. I figure
that if we are going to visit the historic sites of 
the D-Day landings, the least I can do is have
a baseline understanding of the war as a whole and
some more in-depth knowledge of the Allied effort
to reclaim western Europe. We started by watching
Band of Brothers on Netflix, which I highly recommend.
This left me looking for more and I found it in 
the form of a book called Engineers of Victory. 
Admittedly, I did the thing that you're explicitly 
told not to do with books -- I judged it by it's 
cover. But it worked out for me this time. This was 
a great read.

## What was it?
The author of this book attempts to dive into 
5 distinct parts of world war 2 that eventually
led to Allied victory over the Axis Powers. It 
can be a tough read at times because it's written
in the form of what I would call a very well 
reasearched essay. As much as it follows the 
macro picture of the war, it dives into the
specific technologies and processes that ulimately
play a role shaping history as we know it. To the
author, Allied victory boils down to 5 things:
1. Command of the Air
1. Command of the Sea
1. Stopping an Enemy Blitzkreig
1. How to successfully land on an enemy held beach
1. Defeating an enemy that is physically displaced
but still your enemy

Though each point above is separate, there is
a certain degree of interconnectedness. The book
makes a strong effort to emphasize these dependencies
while also highlighting that each aspect is by no
means sequential. Winning World War 2 required an
immense amount of parallel strategic planning,
production, and execution

## What are my takeaways?
### there wasn't just one thing

-- the book does a great job of 
highlighting the parallel nature of the war

-- interconnectedness of everything and
the management of that everything is applicable
to day to day

-- though leaders are extraordinarily 
important to prioritize, motivate and 
operationalize - let it not be forgotten
that the engineers in ww2 are absolutely vital to 
allied victory. American resources coupled
with ingenuity made for a formiddable foe.
