## Why did I start it?
With our upcomming trip to France, I've been
trying to make an effort to learn what I 
wasn't taught or have just forgotten since
taking 20th Century history in high school. I figure
that if we are going to visit the historic sites of 
the D-Day landings, the least I can do is have
a baseline understanding of the war as a whole and
some more in-depth knowledge of the Allied effort
to reclaim western Europe. We started by watching
Band of Brothers on Netflix, which I highly recommend.
This left me looking for more and I found it in 
the form of a book called Engineers of Victory. 
Admittedly, I did the thing that you're explicitly 
told not to do with books -- I judged it by it's 
cover. But it worked out for me this time. This was 
a great read.

## What was it?
The author of this book attempts to dive into 
5 distinct parts of world war 2 that eventually
led to Allied victory over the Axis Powers. It 
can be a tough read at times because it's written
in the form of what I would call a very well 
reasearched essay. As much as it follows the 
macro picture of the war, it dives into the
specific technologies and processes that ulimately
play a role shaping history as we know it. To the
author, Allied victory boils down to 5 things:
1. Command of the Air
1. Command of the Sea
1. Stopping an Enemy Blitzkreig
1. How to successfully land on an enemy held beach
1. Defeating an enemy that is physically displaced
but still your enemy

Though each point above is separate, there is
a certain degree of interconnectedness. The book
makes a strong effort to emphasize these dependencies
while also highlighting that each aspect is by no
means sequential. Winning World War 2 required an
immense amount of parallel strategic planning,
production, and execution

## What are my takeaways?
### there wasn't just one thing
I haven't necessarily read anything about WW2 that
says a single factor or thing led to Allied victory,
but this book really emphasizes how many different
factors played a role. I found it interesting that,
from what I understood, it really was quite the
opposite; there are so many different pieces that
fit into the puzzle of victory. The leaders, the
planners, the actual soldiers, and the engineers of
the weapons used in the field all play a vital role
in the human aspect of the war. At the same time,
the natural resource rich US, and technology that
utilized those resources cannot be understated. And 
then, there's the situational factors like weather
and geography that I never considered prior to 
reading this book. Some of these factors are more
concrete than others. Some contributed to Allied
success and did so entirely out of good luck (e.g. the
dreadful storms over the English Channel immediately
before and soon after D-Day). This
is the prime example of it taking many parts to
make up the whole.  

### parallel war
Often when I have read about WW2, it has been about
the European theater or the Pacific theter. The part
that I never really considered until now is that 
these theaters of war are intimately connected to 
one another. The US had to allocate resources to 
serve both interests at the same time. I imagine it is
challenging to get the right people 
for the job with the right equipment at the right
place at the right time for any war effort. Now add
in the fact that though happening in parallel, 
each theater of war is drastically different (geography, 
enemy, and consequent planning).

### social engineering
I recently heard the world social engineering and how
it is used for modern day cybersecurity attacks. My 
understanding is that a threat actor decieves someone 
into doing something that allows them to infiltrate a 
system. This concept is likely old as dirt - people 
tricking other people. But it's interesting to hear
the extents that the Allies went and the resources they
used in order to decieve the Germans. The British were
making blow up armies to get deliberately caught by
German spy missions to convince the Germans of where
they were building up from. The Americans moved General
Patton away from the Normandy landings because the
Germans would surely think he needed to be present
for the Allies to attempt a European invasion. Code
breakers played important roles in informing Naval
personnel of enemy plans and movements. But radio
chatter also presented a great medium for decieving
the enemy as well. I call out this non-exhaustive
list of deceptions and pieces of intelligence
to highlight that the war wasn't just won by the fact
that the Allies could eventually bulldoze the Axis
Powers. They were also playing a massive game of 
military chess - trying to read the Axis moves while
also making moves themselves that the Axis may take
as bait.

### tech wins
I want to use this section just to list off a few 
pieces of technology that I stuck out to me.
- Hobart's Funnies. These armoured vehicles were
operated by the British and got the "Funnies" 
nickname because they weren't standard at all. They
were effective at what they were designed to do 
though. The one example that sticks out to me is that
there was a tank with long tentacle like chains 
attached to it that would simply thrash the ground
as the tank moved forward in an effort to set off any
mines that were in the path of the tank. 
- The Merlin engine in the P-51 Mustang. The politics
of this situation was surpising. In essence, a British
engineer flew a P-51 (American plane) and said it would
be much better with a Merlin engine (British (Rolls Royce)
engine). The US was apprehensive of putting in the
engine because of the fact that it wasn't our engine.
- The Seabees. These men aren't necessarily a technological
achievement, but they are an operational masterpiece. The
volume of work that the Seabees completed in such limited 
amounts of time while being shot at is astounding. Granted
it's a different world now than what it was back then, but
during my college summers of working for PennDOT, 
construction was an extremely slow process. The Seabees were
seemingly turning around massive projects at breakneck
speed.
- The aircraft carriers. The US designed and built a ton
of new aircraft carries that entered service during the
war. Without ever seeing one, it's hard for me to 
truly fathom how big they are. And they move wicked fast
for how big they are. I think there was mention that
somewhere around 100 planes fit below deck.
- The MVP tech (it's minimum viable product). The books dives
into how the original
American t-34 tank design wasn't necessarily that good, 
but the Soviet's were able to improve it over time to be
one of the wars most formiddable weapons. Similarly,   
the American B-29 that could outrun Japanese zeroes and
fly higher than any plane before came with it's own faults.
I think both of these examples simply highlight that we likely 
aren't going to get it completely right the first time
and we need to leave the door open for future improvements
because you never know - the world may depend on it someday.

### winning complex operations
The macro view of the war presented in this book highlights 
how important having a clear operational plan is to the solution
to a problem. I see this in work enough that someone may
have all of the tools to get the jobs done (i.e. ideas, 
coding expertise, etc), but they may struggle to execute 
on the many moving parts that need to eventually get to a 
solution in a timely fashion. The book attributes a lot 
of careful thought and a clear vision of the desired outcome to 
successful operations.

### engineers matter
I always remember Elon Musk saying something along the 
lines of "stop the MBA-izaton of 
America. We still need engineers to create a product that
is actually worth selling."  I've admittedly always liked
the quote because as an egineering, it feels empowering. It
feels contrary to how I understand a lot of businesses 
operate; putting a lot of effort into financials rather
than the product. 
The conclusion of this
book nicely highlights that many of the things that 
played a big role in the outcome of WW2 are a direct result
of engineers coming up with creative solutions to problems.
Though leaders are very important for prioritization, 
motivation and operationalization, someone will always need
to design solutions to the problems that one must lead through. 
I found this to be rather inspirational for my day-to-day. 
Though I am an entry level software developer right now, 
that might be enough to make an impact on my team, the company,
and maybe even the industry as a whole.
