## The TLDR
Describe when we were there and the super high
level (i.e. where it is, etc)

In February 2023, Grace and I packed our bags 
for Idaho to hit up Brundage Mountain and Bogus Basin (subject of this post) to take advantage of free lift tickets
as part of the Mount Bohemia season pass. 
Bogus is a pretty big resort with a decent variety of terrain - wide open groomers, some steeps, moguls, and technical terrain. It's located just North of Boise, Idaho. 
We had a nice day of skiing when we were there, albeit a bit warm for most of it.

### The would I go back?
Describe if I'd want to go back and why?

I would consider going back to Bogus Basin. I'm
not sure that I would like to spend an entire trip here. There aren't many other resorts 
close by though, so you'd almost have to do this as part of a trip that stays in multiple places. Part of my rationale here is that you almost have to stay in Boise and make the trip up the super windy road every day. The proximity to Boise is a plus for traveling in, but also feels like it could lend to some pretty big crowds. In particular, we noticed a lot of ski clubs arriving 
at night.
The skiing and terrain were a lot of fun though. And if the snow is right, it would be even more fun. Mentioning the snow seems worthwhile because I'm not sure they actually end up with "that" much snow on average. A group of people may find it to be a fun spot for a trip too. There's almost nothing that everyone can't ski and plenty of on mountain amenities. 

## The day
Describe how this day went.

Our day started in the Bogus Parking lot (specifically #4 - Bitterroot & Buttercup). We slept in the car the night before and were nicely positioned to basically ski out from the car down to the ticket window.


## The skiing
Describe mountain stats.
1800' vert
2600 acres 

### The snow
Describe the snow

We got a decently warm day of skiing. At the beginning of the day there was some ice and hard spots from freezing overnight. As the day wore on and the sun got higher, the snow softened up. At lower elevations, there was even a hint of slush/spring corn in the snow. By the end of the day,
cold air and some high winds moved in, rendering all of that soft/wet snow to ice pretty quickly.
