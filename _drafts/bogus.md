## The TLDR
Describe when we were there and the super high
level (i.e. where it is, etc)

In February 2023, Grace and I packed our bags 
for Idaho to hit up Brundage Mountain and Bogus Basin (subject of this post) to take advantage of free lift tickets
as part of the Mount Bohemia season pass. 
Bogus is a pretty big resort with a decent variety of terrain - wide open groomers, some steeps, moguls, and technical terrain. It's located just North of Boise, Idaho. 
We had a nice day of skiing when we were there, albeit a bit warm for most of it.
