## The TLDR
Describe when we were there and the super high
level (i.e. where it is, etc)

We went to Copper Mountain on a Saturday in March 2023
as part of a big family/friend ski trip. This was day
3 of our trip. Though a lot of fun (because by default,
skiing just is), I feel like some of our tactics
around the day leave me with more to be desired.

### The would I go back?
Describe if I'd want to go back and why?

I would most definitely like to go back to Copper under
2 stipuations.
1. We have a smaller group for the day. We were probably
running a group of about 10 people with a wide
variety of abilities.  Couple that with the fact that
only 2 people in our group really knew their way around,
we spent a lot of time making sure we could keep people
together.
1. We don't go on a Saturday. I'll get into it more later on
but Copper is probably always going to be busy on a 
weekend.

On a positive note, Copper definitely has a lot of 
difficult, varying, and fun terrain. With it's elevation being
so high, the snow is probably pretty consistently reliable.
It is likely big enough to accomodate multiple days of 
skiing too. 

## The day
For any context of the different areas I'm talking about in
this section, visit the [Copper Mountain maps].

We had a quick drive to Copper from where we were staying
in Frisco on a cold Saturday morning. We arrived 
early, parked in the free parking lot, and took a Copper 
bus over to the East Village base area. 

It took a little bit of time for the back bowl areas to 
get cleared of avalanches, so we did a few laps on the 
Excelerator list before getting on the Storm King t-bar.
It was cool to actually see the explosions going off in
Spaulding Bowl as ski patrol did their avalanche clearance
work. 

Once open, we spent a good amount of time back in the 
Copper Bowl. Part of this "good amount of time" was in 
the line for the Three Bears lift on on the Three Bears
lift. Part of the problem here is that this lift is not
a high-speed lift, only holds 3 people, and there are 
times that they keep several chairs empty because of 
wind/weight reasons (I assume). We probably didn't take
full advantage of this area when we got to the top. Each
time we went off the lift to skiers right and did this 
long flatish traverse into a hellish wind. Coupled with
some snowboarders, this routinely took a while. The actual
run off of this was a lot of untouched snow and fun though.

We eventually didn't go down to Three Bears and cut off at 
Mountain Chief - another decently long lift line, slow lift
and only a 2 person chair. There was some pretty steep and
rocky terrain off of the top of this. Given it being
almost lunch time, I think we did a few (maybe only 1) run
off of this lift. This is the lift where I broke the news
to Will that Grace and I were expecting a baby!

We evetually made a really long run down to the Center Village
from the top by way of going under the Timberline Express
lift. From Center Village, I belive we hit up the 
American Flyer and American Eagle
lifts before getting to the top of Super Bee (East Village). 
There were a few really fun groomers with trees intermingled 
during this sequence. 

At the top of Super Bee, our group got mixed up. Two of us
ended at the bottom of Resolution chair - a long straight-as-an-arrow 
grueling set of moguls. Everyone else ended up at the bottom
of Alpine. The group eventually ended up at the bottom of 
Alpine was in way over their skis. With no service in the 
area, it took a little bit to get everyone back together. 
After we did, we managed to get a few more hard-packed 
groomer runs in before ending the day at Center Village. 

There's a lot in here. I feel like my summary is that
Copper is huge and we didn't spend much time in
any areas as we covered more of their lifts. 
There was a decent amount of fresh 
snow that they got from the storm that passed through 
the previous day. Coverage was solid everywhere. All in
all, it's impossible to say this was a bad day of skiing. 
I think everyone we were with had a lot of fun.


## The skiing
- 2700' of vert
- 2500 skiable acres

### The snow
We got lucky that a small storm rolled through the day
before we went to Copper. This led to a fair amount of fresh
snow that was untouched in some areas. Given the high altitude
and cold temps, the snow here seemed to be pretty light 
and fluffy. The freshies that we 
found weren't necessarily on the steepest terrain, but they
were still a lot of fun. Coverage on the whole was 
very good - in groomed areas and not. 

### The mountain
Copper is a mix of a lot of terrain. 

The front side of the mountain has several 
long and fast lifts that give access to long runs
that mix between green, blue and black. This has just 
about everything you could want. It's also got some 
nice skiable trees too. The far East side of the mountain 
(Alpine and Resolution lifts) has some tough, steep, and
mogul runs. 
We barely touched the far West side - namely the areas 
around the Sierra and Timberline lifts.  

I don't think we made it into the Spaulding Bowl, but I imagine
it being a similar/tougher version of the far back Copper Bowl. 
The Copper Bowl had some easily accessible outs from the truly gnarly
terrain. If you wanted to ski some real steeps in either of those 
bowls, I think you'd have plenty of skiing.
