To set the stage, I started looking into AG1 in mid-late
2023 after hearing pretty much every podcast I listen 
to offer a discount code for it. 

And to my pleasant surprise, my mother-in-law gave me AG1 for 
Christmas 2023. I drank it every morning during the month of January 2024.

## My experience
To start, I generally run most days of the week before heading to work. I'll have a quick drink of water before heading out or nothing at all. For the month of January 2024, I continued with the routine but took the AG1 as soon as I got up rather than just water. I also took it on mornings when I didn't run. 



## My take
