To set the stage, I started looking into AG1 in mid-late
2023 after hearing pretty much every podcast I listen 
to offer a discount code for it. And to my pleasant
surprise, my mother-in-law gave me AG1 for 
Christmas 2023. I drank it every morning during the month 
of January 2024. In this post, I'll share my
experience using AG1 and how I feel about it
moving forward.

## Some background
On a typical weekday, I wake up and immediately head out
the door to run. I'll typically run 5-6 days per week. On an
off morning, I'll either sleep in or wake up to stretch some.
The goal is usually that I would start running within 15-20
minutes of waking up, so I typically only have a small 
drink of water if anything before heading out. On the weekend, 
I'll ususally run on Saturday soon after
getting up and after mass on Sunday.

Especially during the winter, my goal with running
is to stay healthy. That has proved to be a bit of a 
tall task for me over the years. Luckily this year,
I've been feeling good with respect to running.

Outside of running, I lead a pretty normal life for a 
working age married male with a baby.

I'd like to think I'm generally aware of 
other aspects of my health too - without stressing
about it too much. I try to eat
reasonably healthy, drink only a cup or 2 of coffee each 
day, and sleep as well as you can with a 3 month old. 

## My experience
I fit AG1 into my morning routine by drinking it as 
soon as I woke up before running or otherwise. This
took the place of my small cup of water. I enjoyed
the taste each morning and even looked forward
to it. Otherwise, my weekday routine stayed
the exact same. My running didn't necessarily
improve or faulter during this month. There was a 
week where the temperature barely hit double digits
during the day (making overnight lows at or even well 
below zero), so I set up my bike inside and rode on a 
trainer instead of battling the cold. The bike
generally takes more out of you, so I rode more minutes
than I normally would run in a week too. On occasion,
I noticed that I felt like I needed to pee part
way through a workout, but it was never bad enough
that I couldn't finish my normal plan. This feeling
sometimes happens during normal times too.

As for the rest of my day, I continued doing all of
the other things that I usually do. And generally 
speaking, I felt largely the same as I have in previous
months.

## My take home
I don't plan to continue taking AG1 after this 1 
month trial period. I didn't necessarily feel like
I had more energy or felt better in general over the 
course of this month. I think I liked the idea 
of being guaranteed to get my daily green alotment. 
Though I think we eat pretty healthy, I certainly 
feel like we could eat more vegatables. I recognize
the AG1 website does mention you should expect
to start noticing a difference after 30 days of
taking AG1. My take - this feels more like convienent 
marketting than objective analysis.

Given feeling at best marginally better during the 
trial month, I would be hard pressed to justify 
spending $80 each month. Additionally,
I'm suspect of the fact that if I continued
taking AG1, that I am theoretically on the hook
forever. If I started and decided to stop, I'd be
leaving a "void" in my diet of the nutrients I 
was getting from AG1. I'd like to try to just 
emphasize eating more vegetables and more healthy
in general. For me, that feels a lot more sustainable.
