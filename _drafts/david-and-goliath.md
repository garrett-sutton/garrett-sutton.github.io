I read David and Goliath over the holidays season 
in 2023. Similar to other Gladwell books, this book
seeks to present evidence to support a larger point.
And the point in this book is to try to 
understand why underdogs ever make a story for 
themselves in the first place. I'd really encourage
you to check it out if you want to hear compelling
stories that illustrate themes of how underdogs 
overcome.

## Parenting bit

## Being in a state of challenge - doing hard things

## When goliath isn't humble
