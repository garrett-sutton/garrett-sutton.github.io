I read David and Goliath over the holidays season 
in 2023. Similar to other Gladwell books, this book
seeks to present evidence to support a larger point.
And the point in this book is to try to 
understand why underdogs ever make a story for 
themselves in the first place. I'd really encourage
you to check it out if you want to hear compelling
stories that illustrate themes of how underdogs 
overcome.

Given you can find a review or summary of the book
anywhere online, there isn't much purpose in me
also doing that. I hope to highlight several points
in the book that really provoked me and why.

## Is the reach school the best for me?
Society typically pushes kids theses days to go to
the best school they can get into. And the luster
around going to an elite school also appeals to the
student. However; David and Goliath make the 
point that going to the "better" school (especially
in the case where this the student's reach school)
isn't always better for every student. In fact, 
aside from the top 1% of students at elite schools,
most students end up achieving similar levels of
success in their academic careers (he uses papers
published for Ph.D students) regardless of where
they go to school.

When I was coming out of high school, I was mostly
concerned with being able to run in college and
pursue an engineering degress in the process. 
As a general sports fan and wanting to "prove" 
myself, I dreamt of running at a division 1 school.
I had a few race results that allowed me to have
some conversations with some division 1 coaches,
so I had some hope. At the same time, I was a 
big fish in a little pond. My high school was in the
smaller school divisions of competition and I was 
one of the only guys on my team that took running
very seriously. For a while, I leaned into the fact
that I was having a few visits at division 1 schools
and neglected the later fact. In the classroom, I had
some teachers that were saying things like "engineering
students are best off going to bigger schools." And in 
my friend group, close buddies were going off to Penn
State. I really thought I could make that world happen.

Eventually though, push came to
shove and I was only really presented a scholarship
opportunity at division 2 Gannon University. They also had a 
biomedical engineering program. But the admission rate
was 85%. This wasn't necessarily what I dreamed of, but 
it was going to be the most cost effective option, so I 
went with it. 

Now 9 years later, I can confidently say I'm pretty happy
with my college experience. No, I didn't run division 1 
track or cross country. No, I didn't graduate with a degree
that people around the country have heard of. But in 
reality, I didn't have the chops to run at the division 1
level. Aside from about a three quarters of a season, I 
barely even had the chops to run at the division 2 level. 
I had a lot of fun being around the same level as most of
my teammates rather than having to try to prove to myself
every day that I wasn't the worst guy on the team.

I did well in school, finished with a high GPA, and got
the job Epic (a company that apparently cares a lot 
about GPA) that I'm still working at nearly 5 years later. 
I attribute at least some of my academic success to 
still feeling like a big fish in a little pond. Given the
smaller class sizes at Gannon, I got to know most all of 
my classmates. And in getting to know them, I easily
had access to their minds in times of struggle - whether
it was just me, just them, or all of us struggling. I
think this access to peers was really helpful in me
overcoming any imposter syndrome I faced during college.
The Gannon experience was far from perfect, but generally
speaking, it worked out for me.

Conversely, I've talked with those friends who went to Penn 
State (and did really really well while there), and I'm not 
sure how well I would have done in that environment. 
I could certainly see myself looking around a big lecture hall
in the middle of a difficult lecture and thinking, "wow, 
all of these kids are so much smarter than me" while I neglected
to listen to another 5 minutes of the lecture. I know I would
have worked hard and made it through, but I tend to doubt
I would have done as well. And with that, I doubt I'd have 
ended up with as high of a GPA and likely wouldn't be at Epic
as a result. None of these proposed
realities may actually have led me into a "bad" place, but it
would be different from the happy place I am in today. 

I highlight these points about potentially attending Penn
State because I think I fall outside the norm
in my college selection experience. As is pointed out in
David and Goliath, we're often pushed to reach for the
best school we can possibly imagine. For me, going to the
fall-back school (as I percieved it at the time) may have
been the best thing for me.

small vs big class sizes for kids
money - saying no because can't afford vs no because you just aren't


## Being in a state of challenge - doing hard things

## When goliath isn't humble
