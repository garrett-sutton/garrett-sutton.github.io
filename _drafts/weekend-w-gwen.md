## why is dad staying home alone with Gwen
Grace was invited to a bachelorette party 
in Rhode Island for Memorial Day weekend 2024. 
She left on Friday after dropping Gwen at
daycare and would be back home in the early
evening on Monday. Gwen and I were tasked with 
holding down the fort for the weekend.

## how did Gwen do?
I won't bore you with all of the nitty
gritty details on how Gwen did for this weekend.
As you can imagine, she did fine. She played
well, slept well, napped well and ate well.
She did great during the couple of runs we
were able to get out for in the jogging stroller
and was well behaved in mass on Sunday - despite
not hanging in her seat at all. 

The 2 notable things for this weekend from
a Gwen standpoint:
1. She started rolling all over the place. On a 
couple of nights, she would just roll around 
her room and giggle away as I crawled around her.
It was really fun.
1. She fell asleep in her playpen and on her
floor in the same day. I may have pushed her to 
stay awake a little longer than she should have
but she didn't necessarily seem upset leading
up to either of these points.
