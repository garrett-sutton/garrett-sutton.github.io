## why is dad staying home alone with Gwen
Grace was invited to a bachelorette party 
in Rhode Island for Memorial Day weekend 2024. 
She left on Friday after dropping Gwen at
daycare and would be back home in the early
evening on Monday. Gwen and I were tasked with 
holding down the fort for the weekend.

## how did Gwen do?
I won't bore you with all of the nitty
gritty details on how Gwen did for this weekend.
As you can imagine, she did fine. She played
well, slept well, napped well and ate well.
She did great during the couple of runs we
were able to get out for in the jogging stroller
and was well behaved in mass on Sunday - despite
not hanging in her seat at all. 

The 2 notable things for this weekend from
a Gwen standpoint:
1. She started rolling all over the place. On a 
couple of nights, she would just roll around 
her room and giggle away as I crawled around her.
It was really fun.
1. She fell asleep in her playpen and on her
floor in the same day. I may have pushed her to 
stay awake a little longer than she should have
but she didn't necessarily seem upset leading
up to either of these points.

## how did dad do?
From the beginning of Grace talking about 
going on this trip, I was nervous. Some of it
was selfish - knowing that I had a lot more
responsibility to take on for that weekend. A 
lot of it was a lack of confidence that I could
shoulder that responsibility.

I've spent a day at home with Gwen before, but
Grace was only a 20 minute 
drive away and she was going to be home in
time for dinner at the latest. Even on these
days at home, I still feel pretty reliant on 
Grace for help with the little things. She 
makes sure Gwen is off to a good start in the
morning, takes inventory on the milk situation,
and provides a real break when she arrives home. 
And nighttime is a whole separate beast. Grace
typically goes into Gwen's room to 
console her when she wakes up in the middle of 
the night. Any time Gwen is going through a 
rough patch, I've had Grace around to share
the load. But this was going to be different.

What if Gwen was up all night long? What if 
she wouldn't eat? What if she ran out of 
frozen milk? What if she was unconsolable
for hours on end? And if any of these fears 
became reality, I was faced with many more
questions. When would I go to the bathroom?
When would I shower? When would I eat? When
would I sleep? These fears may sound dramatic
(largely because they are), but they weren't 
necessarily outside the realm of possibility.

Time moved quickly and suddenly, the weekend was 
here. And like I mentioned above, Gwen did really well.
Many of the fears I was stressing about never
came to life. They still lingered in the back
of my mind when Gwen had a small spat or
demanded that I stay close by for a period of time.
But as the weekend progressed, it felt like my
confidence continued to grow. I came to realize 
that there were going to be points in time that
Gwen was upset and I couldn't immediately help
her out because something else needed to get done,
but she was going to be OK. 

We didn't just survive this weekend
either. I'll speak for myself (hard to speak for the
now 9 month old), but I did have a lot of fun.
Gwen seemingly grew before my eyes. And she is so
expressive at this point in her short life that
it felt like the 2 of us bonded a lot more than we 
have prevously. I wouldn't be thrilled if Grace made
a habit of being gone for days at a time, but at least
now I know that I can do more than just hold down
the fort.
