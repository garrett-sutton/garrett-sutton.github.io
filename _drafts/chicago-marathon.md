I ran the 2024 chicago marathon. This post goes through
how the race went and what I would consider doing differently.

## how did the race go?
The race did not go very well for me. I was nervous leading in
and I don't know how much of a shot I had mentally from the
start. We handled all of the logistical things well - train was
empty, got into the start area, gear check, and almost into the 
corral. Not getting into the corral was also not a big deal. 
We eventually funneled in after the first corral was let loose. 

Then I got started. I tried a new approach of shutting off 
auto-lap for the race. This meant that I had to take my own
splits (i.e. see the mile split signs and press the split button).
This was generally fine. I recall 2 years ago at Twin Cities that
it was a bit annoying that my watch was sayign somethign and that 
the race splits were sayign another thing. That led me to some
feeling of "I'm on pace" but hte reality is that I was off pace
a little bit each mile. Anyway, I got started and I missed
the very first mile split. I don't think that was detrimental,
but it was weird. I did start out a bit slower than i may have 
wanted. I think the starting slow point is hard to grapple with. 
There's a certain point where I was convincing myself that I 
could make up for it later on and that I shoudl just ease into
it. It is a really long race after all. There is another part of
me that thinks this mentality of the start left me doomed from 
the start. There's a certain part of this race that seemingly
requires a bit of crazy from the very begining to actually
execute. Whichever it was, I do think I got on track to run
a decent race after a few miles. There's a lot of weaving in
and out of people early on and warming up anyway.

I didn't have a great plan leading in about hwo I was going 
to my fueling. I thought 4 gels would be good but was soemwhat
convinced that a 5th one would help me out. To take 5 gels, 
I figured on the fly that I should take a gel really early and
then settle into the cadence of taking gels. I did take a gel
at ~3, but the problem is that I then took another one at 
like 6 miles, and then another one at like 9 miles. 3 points to
make of this:
1. I think this was too many gels in this short of time. I didn't
have a strict plan going in and I honestly think I misjudged
the math of when I needed to take them after took the first one.
1. I think I was a bit pannicked and I definitely did similar
things in training. When things got hard, i would go to a gel 
and because of how I did long run workouts (long M paced intervals),
I would just take them between each interval (rather than every
40 minutes like the packaging says).
1. I had a strawberry kiwi honey stinger gel that didn't 
necessarily sit badly with me, but I didn't love how it felt
going down. I recall this feeling in training, but i largely 
ignored it.

Around the 10k mark, I felt like I needed to pee and I decided it was
best to pull off really quick around 10k and pee. Again, I felt
calm about that decision and that it was a good decision. After
peeing, I could see my friend Brian otu in frnt of me and I made
my way back up to him. It was nice to have someone to run with for a 
little bit. Though there are so many people cheering on the course,
it's a sort of anonymous cheering. It was comfortable to have
someone familiar around. Around 9 miles, I was admittedly starting
to not feel great and starting to think about how much race I still
had to go. This feeling was exacerbated by a sign that I caught a
glimpse of that said "only 17 miles to go." That's a horrible sign.
And it shouldn't have bothered me, but I think it did get into
my head a little bit. From there on out, I feel like I was thinking
about the finish rather than intermediate checkpoints along the way.

Around mile 11, I saw Grant cheering for us and then Brian started
to pull away from me. Also at this point, I think I recovered a 
little bit. I saw a sign that said "Who's gonna carry the boats?" 
This David Goggins reference got me goign for a few miles. And 
I came through the halfway mark at ~1:28, not particularly good,
but I wasn't completely out of it either. Mentally, I think
I was really already starting to fade by now though.

For waht felt like the entire second half of hte race, I just
struggled. I definitely considered a DNF early into the second half
just by the nature of how close to teh finish I was at that point.
For a little while, I was able ot keep 7:XX rolling,
but eventually that even became hard. I wasn't feeling hungry
(maybe becasue I stuffed myself early on ? ), but I felt like there
was no pop in my legs. I walked to eat a gel during mile 16 to
try to get some sort of something going agian. And for a really
short time I did get going again. This was largely fueled
by the fact that I got a "good job movin shoes" from a passing
runner. And I realized that the guy givng me encouragement 
was the same guy that I finished the Twin Cities Marathon
with 2 years ago. Talk about deja vu. We chatted for a little bit
before he also pulled away. But whatever I got from that
interaction did not last long. 

Miles passed by slowly. Interestingly, even in my pain, I had the 
energy to think about how silly the bio freeze aid station was around
mile 19. People were simply spraying biofreeze on runner's legs 
and then the runners would continue on. I thought it seemed 
ridiculous and I would never do such a thing. But not 400 meters
after passing the station, my legs started to feel like they might
cramp up. Great. Now the joke was on me. From this point forward, 
I walked through nearly every aid station getting as much gatorage and
water as I could to try to hold off the impending lock up of 
leg muscles. Miles continued to get slower. After mile 20, i told
myself it was definitely no longer worth it to take splits on 
my watch. I eventually made it to Michigan ave and made the turn 
south - a rather demoralizign move as you see the 24 mile marker
on the other side of the road and all of the runners ahead of you.
I continued slogging along, each mile feeling slower than the last
one. I heard Grant cheering for me at just after 25 miles. And
at that point, my legs finally locked up. I walked a few steps
and was able to miraculously start back up again and run for the
last mile. This was painful.

As the sole bright spot to this otherwise forgetable race, when
I crossed the finish line, I spotted Meb Keflezghi. He was 
standing by himself on the other side of the finishing rail
and he said hi to me and gave me a fist pump. That was pretty
cool.
