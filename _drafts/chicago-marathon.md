I ran the 2024 chicago marathon. This post goes through
how the race went and what I would consider doing differently.

## how did the race go?
The race did not go very well for me. I was nervous leading in
and I don't know how much of a shot I had mentally from the
start. We handled all of the logistical things well - train was
empty, got into the start area, gear check, and almost into the 
corral. Not getting into the corral was also not a big deal. 
We eventually funneled in after the first corral was let loose. 

Then I got started. I tried a new approach of shutting off 
auto-lap for the race. This meant that I had to take my own
splits (i.e. see the mile split signs and press the split button).
This was generally fine. I recall 2 years ago at Twin Cities that
it was a bit annoying that my watch was sayign somethign and that 
the race splits were sayign another thing. That led me to some
feeling of "I'm on pace" but hte reality is that I was off pace
a little bit each mile. Anyway, I got started and I missed
the very first mile split. I don't think that was detrimental,
but it was weird. 

I did start out a bit slower than i may have 
wanted. I think the starting slow point is hard to grapple with. 
There's a certain point where I was convincing myself that I 
could make up for it later on and that I shoudl just ease into
it. It is a really long race after all. There is another part of
me that thinks this mentality of the start left me doomed from 
the start. There's a certain part of this race that seemingly
requires a bit of crazy from the very begining to actually
execute. Whichever it was, I do think I got on track to run
a decent race after a few miles. There's a lot of weaving in
and out of people early on and warming up anyway.

I didn't have a great plan leading in about hwo I was going 
to my fueling. I thought 4 gels would be good but was soemwhat
convinced that a 5th one would help me out. To take 5 gels, 
I figured on the fly that I should take a gel really early and
then settle into the cadence of taking gels. I did take a gel
at ~3, but the problem is that I then took another one at 
like 6 miles, and then another one at like 9 miles. 3 points to
make of this:
1. I think this was too many gels in this short of time. I didn't
have a strict plan going in and I honestly think I misjudged
the math of when I needed to take them after took the first one.
1. I think I was a bit pannicked and I definitely did similar
things in training. When things got hard, i would go to a gel 
and because of how I did long run workouts (long M paced intervals),
I would just take them between each interval (rather than every
40 minutes like the packaging says).
1. I had a strawberry kiwi honey stinger gel that didn't 
necessarily sit badly with me, but I didn't love how it felt
going down. I recall this feeling in training, but i largely 
ignored it.

Around the 10k mark, I felt like I needed to pee and I decided it was
best to pull off really quick around 10k and pee. Again, I felt
calm about that decision and that it was a good decision. After
peeing, I could see my friend Brian otu in frnt of me and I made
my way back up to him. It was nice to have someone to run with for a 
little bit. Though there are so many people cheering on the course,
it's a sort of anonymous cheering. It was comfortable to have
someone familiar around. Around 9 miles, I was admittedly starting
to not feel great and starting to think about how much race I still
had to go. This feeling was exacerbated by a sign that I caught a
glimpse of that said "only 17 miles to go." That's a horrible sign.
And it shouldn't have bothered me, but I think it did get into
my head a little bit. From there on out, I feel like I was thinking
about the finish rather than intermediate checkpoints along the way.

Around mile 11, I saw Grant cheering for us and then Brian started
to pull away from me. Also at this point, I think I recovered a 
little bit. I saw a sign that said "Who's gonna carry the boats?" 
This David Goggins reference got me goign for a few miles. And 
I came through the halfway mark at ~1:28, not particularly good,
but I wasn't completely out of it either. Mentally, I think
I was really already starting to fade by now though.

For waht felt like the entire second half of hte race, I just
struggled. I definitely considered a DNF early into the second half
just by the nature of how close to teh finish I was at that point.
For a little while, I was able ot keep 7:XX rolling,
but eventually that even became hard. I wasn't feeling hungry
(maybe becasue I stuffed myself early on ? ), but I felt like there
was no pop in my legs. I walked to eat a gel during mile 16 to
try to get some sort of something going agian. And for a really
short time I did get going again. This was largely fueled
by the fact that I got a "good job movin shoes" from a passing
runner. And I realized that the guy givng me encouragement 
was the same guy that I finished the Twin Cities Marathon
with 2 years ago. Talk about deja vu. We chatted for a little bit
before he also pulled away. But whatever I got from that
interaction did not last long. 

Miles passed by slowly. Interestingly, even in my pain, I had the 
energy to think about how silly the bio freeze aid station was around
mile 19. People were simply spraying biofreeze on runner's legs 
and then the runners would continue on. I thought it seemed 
ridiculous and I would never do such a thing. But not 400 meters
after passing the station, my legs started to feel like they might
cramp up. Great. Now the joke was on me. From this point forward, 
I walked through nearly every aid station getting as much gatorage and
water as I could to try to hold off the impending lock up of 
leg muscles. Miles continued to get slower. After mile 20, i told
myself it was definitely no longer worth it to take splits on 
my watch. I eventually made it to Michigan ave and made the turn 
south - a rather demoralizign move as you see the 24 mile marker
on the other side of the road and all of the runners ahead of you.
I continued slogging along, each mile feeling slower than the last
one. I heard Grant cheering for me at just after 25 miles. And
at that point, my legs finally locked up. I walked a few steps
and was able to miraculously start back up again and run for the
last mile. This was painful.

As the sole bright spot to this otherwise forgetable race, when
I crossed the finish line, I spotted Meb Keflezghi. He was 
standing by himself on the other side of the finishing rail
and he said hi to me and gave me a fist pump. That was pretty
cool. 

## atmosphere and experience
Running the chicago marathon is by far the biggest race that I've
ever been a part of. It's truly a unique experience. We had a
nearly perfect day for the marathon - upper 50s/lower 60s, mostly
cloudy and CALM. The city of Chicago certainly showed out all
over the course. There were fans from all over the world - notably
Mexican fans. They were by far the loudest/most excited.
Some points had a lot more energy than other
but I don't think I ever felt like I was alone. I'd even go so
far as to highlight the fact that, annoyingly, many many fans 
ran out right in front of me as they were trying to cross streets.
All of the fans are obviously out for a reason - the race is
ginormous. 

This year's field was over 52,000 runners. It was cool to be a 
part of so many people. It was also difficult. Especially in the
first half when I was still passing people, I felt like I was 
constantly weaving in and out of people, missing out on any sort of 
straight line. 

## small things to do differently
I'd like to highlight a few small things that with hindsight I might
do differently next time.

### get new shoes
I wore a pair of Saucony Endorphin Pro 2s for the race. I had wore 
these shoes for TCM 2 years ago and felt like I had not worth them
enough in order to justify a new pair of shoes. These things are
quick expensive, and I was feeling like my current pair would be
just fine. And maybe on a better day, I would have been just fine. 
I only note this because when I was slogging through the second half,
my feet started to feel it. 

### take some time off
I arrived in Chicago from Madison at around 1 pm on Saturday and left
town by 4 pm on Sunday. The drive back wasn't necessarily 
pleasant either. The problem here is that I woke up on Sunday morning
fretting about the drive home and how tired I would be. I think it
would have served me a bit better to take at least the morning off on
Monday after the race so that I could feel like I could relax and
not need to make a rushed and tired 2-3 hour drive home. It was
really great to get home on Sunday night when I eventually did,
but I think the looming feeling of the drive was in the back
of my head at points in time. 

## what would I do differently?
There are 3 pieces that come to mind around what I could do better
for my next marathon:

### 1. More mental preparation
I think some physical things went wrong for me during this race,
but I would point the biggest finger at my own head for how this
race went. In hindsight, I'm not fully convinced how ready I was
to actually go hurt for this race. The marathon seems like the
type of thing that will always go poorly if you are trying to
get out of hurting. More specifically, I let the distance 
itself get into my head pretty early. I think in previous races 
(TCM & the virtual marathon I did), I did a good job of getting
to checkpoints during the race. I could get to 10, then just 3 miles
to half way, then 3 more miles to 16, then 4 miles to 20, etc. 
Instead, I was just thinking about having 16 miles to go at mile
10. That's not a winning mentality. 

Having a better pacing plan would also probably be beneficial for
me. Grant and Brian are constantly talking about their pacing
techniques and when i hear how much they intend to negative split,
it seems too hard to me. It feels like that to me because of how
much you actually need to speed up. I'd like to think that I'm a
bit better served by starting a more honest pace and being
consistent. However; for the second straight marathon, I think
I just didn't do a great job being intimately aware of the 
pace. And some of that may be fear on race day. Some might be
a lack of execution of the pace during training. 

### 2. Emphasize the long run effort
When I finished TCM in October 2022, I left a note to myself that
I wanted to run more at marathon pace because it felt liek I didnt'
know how to execute on it very well during the race. So for this
build up, I incorporated workouts into the last phase of trianing
to have marathon paced running and I did long run workouts every
other week with marathon paced intervals. 

After running Chicago, I'll acknowledge that I didn't do a 
very good job with the long run workouts during this build. I was
pretty consistently missing paces but I always had an excuse for it
- running on dirt that is slower, it's hot, etc.

After having a conversation with Grant, I'm feeling like I didn't
get this quite right. Grant mentioned that he uses the long
run workout as the foundation of his marathon training. To make 
training less stressful, I intentionally did what I did for this
build. I wanted to be aware of waht marathon pace felt like and 
feel confident in that pace on race day. The reality is that
I'm not sure how confident I ever really felt in the pace.

If I were to do things differently, I would likely try to 
incorporate harder running into the long run workouts that I was
doing. Maybe 20 minute M pace intervals just turned into a semi-easy
run, especially when I was laxed about the pace. This should 
probably include some hard running with maybe shorter half 
marathon paced intervals or longer progression runs or fast
finish long runs. I'd also skip out on the M paced running
during the weekday workouts. That seems like a place better
suited for V02 max intervals (no matter how much I hate 
them) or longer tempo. 

In my conversation with Grant, he went so far as mentioning he
uses the long run workout as the foundation of his training. I
don't think I was doing that during this build. I think I had
a good build but I don't think I did any workouts that truly 
pushed the limits that would ultimately give me some more 
confidence on race day.

### 3. Have a clear plan on fuel
I mentioned this above, but I'll reiterate here. I need to have a 
clear plan on fueling going into the next marathon. I don't think
this was the end-all for me, but it certainly doesn't feel like
a path to success.
