## Background
The contents of this post are based on and include
a note that I wrote on my phone after this trip
to Colorado in March 2021. 

To set the stage, my friend Will and I planned this trip
at the last minute. We planned to fly
into Denver on the evening of Thursday March 11 and stay
in Idaho Springs, CO (just off I70) on Thursday and 
Friday night. After finishing skiing on Saturday, we'd
drive back to Denver and stay at an airport hotel to
catch a flight home on Sunday.

## The note from my phone
```
Got stuck here for 2 extra days lol due to unprecedented storm
March 12-13

-- snow is different
--- less of it
--- felt like more risk of bad coverage
--- ice crusts can form with high elevation
--- ice exists from wind

-- ski experience
--- solid. Few crowds (abasin/loveland)
--- beautiful and BIG and feels remote
--- range of intermediate/advanced terrain (loveland much
 more mellow than abasin)
--- abasin is probably the hardest place I've ever skied 
(consider that a +&-)
--- also big bowls are sweet and even sometimes exist 
without moguls
--- also above treeline, trees and trails
--- affordable (especially loveland)
--- high elevation can beat you up
--- only 1 high speed lift we found (but that might be a +)
--- some wild hike to terrain (absolute sufferfest)

-- accessibility
--- cannot stay in Denver
--- leaves a small town hoping for motel or air bnb or 
frisco/Silverthorn (with respect to Loveland/abasin) 
which may be decently close
--- I-70 feels sketchy but that's probably because of 
the storm we ran into (Xylia)

## My 3 years later recollection 
### Skiing A-basin
I won't write a full review of A-Basin here because it's 
been nearly 3 years since I was there. In short, A-Basin 
was wicked - in wind and in terrain.  I'd be hard pressed 
to believe a day ever goes by at the top of A-Basin where 
you aren't at risk of being blown away and then sliding 
uncontrollably down it's wind swept high alpine terrain. 
It felt like almost every run was steep, had bumps or 
rocks! One run in particular sticks out - the Steep Gullies.

The Steep Gullies are wicked steep, exposed, and narrow. It's
the type of run you want to avoid falling on at all costs.
Will lost a ski going down and in retrospect, I still think 
it was a lot more dangerous than we understood in the moment. 
It took quite a while just to get a ski back on because of 
the rocks, narrowness and steepness. All of this is to say 
this is probably the toughest run I've skiied to date.
The kicker to the Steep Gullies is the "15-minute" walk 
back to the lift at the bottom. As relatively fit 24 
year-olds, we anticipated this 15-minutes was an estimate 
for your grandma. In reality, walking uphill in ski boots 
on snow while carrying skis at over 11000' is no joke. We 
probably walked for a least 20 minutes 

### The Storm
Our initial plan was to fly into Denver on a Thursday night, 
ski Friday (A-Basin), Saturday (Loveland), and fly out of 
Denver on Sunday. After Saturday skiing we had an airport 
hotel lined up to make it as easy as possible to get out 
on Sunday. 

I first got wind of this storm as I was talking to the 
lady sitting next to me on the plane. As one does, I mostly 
nodded and smiled and didn't think much else of it. I was 
really hoping for this storm to come and to maybe even come 
a little early so we could get some goods during our skiing. 
I didn't quite get what I wished for (though it did start 
dumping at Loveland by the end of our day of skiing), but 
that lady on the plane's concerns quickly became reality. 
Before we even started skiing on Saturday morning, Will 
was notified his flight was cancelled. I got my flight 
cancellation notification when we finished skiing.

Thinking we still had a chance to get out of might as well 
be prepared to, we left Loveland on Saturday afternoon and 
headed to the airport hotel we were staying at. At that point, 
I recall Will got on hold with United to figure out his 
flight home. We took our car back to the rental center, 
rode the rental bus over to the airport and then waited 
what felt like forever for our hotel shuttle to pick us 
up and bring us back to the hotel. While waiting, I think 
Will just handled his flight situation by going into the 
airport and talking with the United folks. He was set to 
fly out Monday afternoon. 

We eventually made it back to the hotel, where it was getting 
pretty late with not a lot of food options available. Enter 
the Tower Tap and Grill at the Hilton next to our hotel. We 
got seated and had a nice meal on this Saturday night.

After dinner, the storm had intensified. It was dumping snow 
really fast as we walked across the parking lot. Then, Will 
realized he didn't have his ID and determined it was back at 
the airport. oof. It was a next morning problem. At this point, 
I started my own 2 hour journey on hold with Frontier Airlines. 
When I finally got situated, I had a flight for early Monday 
morning. 

On Sunday morning, it was still snowing and somehow snowing 
harder. Will found a ride to the airport via the airport shuttle 
to get his ID. I looked up where I could find Sunday mass and 
by what might be a miracle, there was a Church only a quarter 
of a mile from the hotel. I emailed the priest to see that mass 
was still on and got lucky that he responded to say Mass was on 
despite the weather. After trudging through a borderline blizzard, 
I arrived at a shopping plaza and what looked like an old Verizon 
store where the Church was supposed to be. I got over the confusion 
and went inside fully expecting to be in the wrong place. Turns 
out, this was the place - a small repurposed retail space. Mass 
was filled by a small number of people that obviously all knew 
each other, including the priest. It was different but really 
nice to share that mass with them. 

By the time Sunday evening rolled around, I think it was still 
snowing, my flight had been cancelled and I was scheduled to get 
out on Tuesday. We were on the lookout for a place to eat again. 
There was no restaurant in our hotel and no sane person was going 
out to work or eat in this storm. So Tower Tap & Grill round 2. On 
arrival, we found a sign saying Hilton guests only, but out of 
desperation and the only real consequence being they turn us away, 
we put our name in at the host stand and managed to get a table. 
Dinner - success! Night time TV - maybe not so much. I recall us 
watching the Grammy's and seeing Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion 
performing WAP. Yikes. 

On Monday, it was like the apocalypse outside. Still nothing was 
open, the sun was out and suddenly the over foot of snow was melting 
like crazy. Before Will headed to the airport, we tried to go to 
Ruby Tuesdays. The manager there told us they might open for dinner. 
But in our journey around this area of airport hotels, it was like 
people were just wandering like zombies from one restaurant to 
another in hopes of it being open. I'm pretty sure we only got 
chocolate milk and chips ahoy from our hotel convenience area. 
Wild. 

Will left and I was on my own with the my flight not being until 
Tuesday. Given it's proximity and fear no where else was open, I 
naturally made my way back to the Tower Tap & Grill that was still 
only serving Hilton guests. Three nights in a row at the same place. 
That feels like some sort of record. To reminisce, we did go here 
at the end of our ski trip in 2023. 

Finally, Tuesday came and I managed to make it back to Madison 
in one piece. What a whirlwind of a trip. I look back on this 
and it really was a ton of fun. It stunk to get holed up in a 
hotel room for 2+ days, but it's fun story to look back on. 

the end.
