## Background
The contents of this post are based on and include
a note that I wrote on my phone after this trip
to Colorado in March 2021. 

To set the stage, my friend Will and I planned this trip
at sorta the last minute. We planned to fly
into Denver on the evening of Thursday March 11 and stay
in Idaho Springs, CO (just off I70) on Thursday and 
Friday night. After finishing skiing on Saturday, we'd
drive back to Denver and stay at an airport hotel to
catch a flight home on Sunday March 14.

## The note from my phone
```
Got stuck here for 2 extra days lol due to unprecedented storm
March 12-13

-- snow is different
--- less of it
--- felt like more risk of bad coverage
--- ice crusts can form with high elevation
--- ice exists from wind

-- ski experience
--- solid. Few crowds (abasin/loveland)
--- beautiful and BIG and feels remote
--- range of intermediate/advanced terrain (loveland much more mellow than abasin)
--- abasin is probably the hardest place I've ever skied (consider that a +&-)
--- also big bowls are sweet and even sometimes exist without moguls
--- also above treeline, trees and trails
--- affordable (especially loveland)
--- high elevation can beat you up
--- only 1 high speed lift we found (but that might be a +)
--- some wild hike to terrain (absolute sufferfest)

-- accessibility
--- cannot stay in Denver
--- leaves a small town hoping for motel or air bnb or frisco/Silverthorn (with respect to Loveland/abasin) which may be decently close
--- I-70 feels sketchy but that's probably because of the storm we ran into (Xylia)

## My 3 years later recollection 
### Skiing A-basin
I won't write a full review of A-Basin here because it's been nearly 3 years since I was there. In short, A-Basin was wicked - in wind and in terrain.  I'd be hard pressed to believe a day ever goes by at the top of A-Basin where you aren't at risk of being blown away and then sliding uncontrollably down it's wind swept high alpine terrain. It felt like almost every run was steep, had bumps or rocks! One run in particular sticks out - the Steep Gullies.

The Steep Gullies are wicked steep, exposed, and narrow. Will lost a ski going down and in retrospect, I still think it was a lot more dangerous than we understood in the moment. It took quite a while just to get a ski back on because of the rocks, narrowness and steepness. All of this is to say this is probably the toughest run I've skiied to date.
The kicker to the Steep Gullies is the "15-minute" walk back to the lift at the bottom. As relatively fit 24 year-olds, we anticipated this 15-minutes was an estimate for your grandma. In reality, walking uphill in ski boots on snow while carrying skis at over 11000' is no joke. We probably walked for a least 20 minutes 

### The Storm
Our initial plan was to fly into Denver on a Thursday night, ski Friday (A-Basin), Saturday (Loveland), and fly out of Denver on Sunday. After Saturday skiing we had an airport hotel lined up to make it as easy as possible to get out on Sunday. 

I first got wind of this storm as I was talking to the lady sitting next to me on the plane. As one does, I mostly nodded and smiled and didn't think much else of it. I was really hoping for this storm to come and to maybe even come a little early so we could get some goods during our skiing. I didn't quite get what I wished for (though it did start dumping at Loveland by the end of our day of skiing), but that lady on the plane's concerns quickly became reality. Before we even started skiing on Saturday morning, Will was notified his flight was cancelled. I got my flight cancellation notification when we finished skiing.

Thinking we still had a chance to get out of might as well be prepared to, we left Loveland on Saturday afternoon and headed to the airport hotel we were staying at. At that point, I recall Will got on hold with United to figure out his flight home. We took our car back to the rental center, rode the rental bus over to the airport and then waited what felt like forever for our hotel shuttle to pick us up and bring us back to the hotel. While waiting, I think Will just handled his flight situation by going into the airport and talking with the United folks. He was set to fly out Monday afternoon. 

We eventually made it back to the hotel, where it was getting pretty late with not a lot of food options available. Enter the Tower Tap and Grill at the Hilton next to our hotel. We got seated and had a nice meal on this Saturday night.

After dinner, the storm had really intensified. It was dumping snow really fast as we walked across the parking lot. Then, Will realized he didn't have his ID and determined it was back at the airport. oof. It was a next morning problem. At this point, I started my own 2 hour journey on hold with Frontier. When I finally got situated, I had a flight for early Monday morning. 

SUNDAY

TODO 
Clarify/add some details about:
- Getting stuck including eating dinner at that hotel bar each night
    - The miracoulous Church that appeared on Sunday morning
    - The context of this being a month before wedding
- skiing the steep gullies at abasin
