## Background
The contents of this post are based on and include
a note that I wrote on my phone after this trip
to Colorado in March 2021. 

To set the stage, my friend Will and I planned this trip
at sorta the last minute. We planned to fly
into Denver on the evening of Thursday March 11 and stay
in Idaho Springs, CO (just off I70) on Thursday and 
Friday night. After finishing skiing on Saturday, we'd
drive back to Denver and stay at an airport hotel to
catch a flight home on Sunday March 14.

## The note from my phone
```
Got stuck here for 2 extra days lol due to unprecedented storm
March 12-13

-- snow is different
--- less of it
--- felt like more risk of bad coverage
--- ice crusts can form with high elevation
--- ice exists from wind

-- ski experience
--- solid. Few crowds (abasin/loveland)
--- beautiful and BIG and feels remote
--- range of intermediate/advanced terrain (loveland much more mellow than abasin)
--- abasin is probably the hardest place I've ever skied (consider that a +&-)
--- also big bowls are sweet and even sometimes exist without moguls
--- also above treeline, trees and trails
--- affordable (especially loveland)
--- high elevation can beat you up
--- only 1 high speed lift we found (but that might be a +)
--- some wild hike to terrain (absolute sufferfest)

-- accessibility
--- cannot stay in Denver
--- leaves a small town hoping for motel or air bnb or frisco/Silverthorn (with respect to Loveland/abasin) which may be decently close
--- I-70 feels sketchy but that's probably because of the storm we ran into (Xylia)

## Additional story telling
TODO 
Clarify/add some details about:
- Getting stuck including eating dinner at that hotel bar each night
    - The miracoulous Church that appeared on Sunday morning
    - The context of this being a month before wedding
- skiing the steep gullies at abasin
