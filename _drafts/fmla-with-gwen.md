## why did i do this? circumstances?
Long before Grace was pregnant with Gwen, I
was warned about how long it takes to 
get a baby into daycare. So when we found
out Grace was expecting, one of our early
stresses was to find a daycare. To our 
suprise, we were able to get into a daycare
for March 1. This beats the seemingly forever
wait lists that we heard about at other
places. Even though we were getting into a 
daycare with relative ease, it still wasn't
going to line up with Grace's time off. 
We're extremely fortunate that she could
take 16 weeks off, but that doesn't get
us all the way to 5 months. To handle this,
we had a revolving door of help - Grace's 
aunt, her parents (for 2 weeks), my aunt, 
and my mom. And I got to fill in for 
2 separate weeks too! 
TODO - ADD FMLA OR NOT

## week 1
Gwen had just turned 4 months old. This was
a good week. Several walks. I have notes on 
this in issue.
I feel like this was a bit of an eye opening
week. I definitely did some battling with
her to sleep during the day. It's certainly 
difficult. I feel like I was trying to check
off some boxes around the house while she slept, 
but it was difficult to get going at times
if Gwen only sleeps for 30-40 minutes.

## week 2
This was the last week before Gwen went to
daycare. I was really only on my own with her 
for 3 days becasue Grace worked from home
on Monday and Friday (only worked half day on 
Friday too). I feel like I was more confident
about this week, but I wouldn't say it went
"smoother." Based on my phone notes, I tried
to stretch her food a bit longer and keep her
awake until she was definitely tired. I definitely
had lower expectations on what I wanted to 
get done this week. I think we still made it out 
for a few walks that helped her get some
sleep later in the day.
