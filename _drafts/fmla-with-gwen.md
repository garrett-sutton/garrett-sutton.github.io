## why did i do this? circumstances?
Long before Grace was pregnant with Gwen, I
was warned about how long it takes to 
get a baby into daycare. So when we found
out we were expecting, one of our early
stresses was to find a daycare. To our 
surprise, we were able to get into a daycare
for March 1 (Gwen would be ~5 months old). 
This beats the seemingly forever
wait lists that we heard about at other
places. Even though we were getting into  
daycare with relative ease, it still wasn't
going to line up with Grace's time off. 
We're extremely fortunate that she could
take 16 weeks off, but that doesn't get
us to 5 months. To handle this,
we had a revolving door of help - Grace's 
aunt, her parents (for 2 weeks), my aunt, 
and my mom. And I got to fill in for 
2 separate weeks too! 

The focus of this post is largely to recap
the 2 weeks that I spent at home with Gwen.

### week 1
Gwen had just turned 4 months old. This was
a good week. We went on several walks and Gwen 
was generally pretty happy while she was awake. 

At the same time, this was a bit of an eye-opening
week. There's not a lot of downtime with a 4-month-old. 
I was trying to check a few boxes during this 
week that turned out to be hard to check when
Gwen only slept for 30-40 minutes at a time. I 
also had to work for some of that sleep too, trying a
few times to actually get her to sleep. In the
same breath, she did give me some longer naps
that no one else was able to get out of her.

### week 2
This was the last week before Gwen went to
daycare. I was only on my own with her 
for 3 days because Grace worked from home
on Monday and Friday (only worked half a day on 
Friday too). I feel like I was more confident
about this week, but I wouldn't say it went
"smoother." Based on my phone notes, I tried
to stretch her food a bit longer and keep her
awake until she was definitely tired. I 
had lower expectations of what I wanted to 
get done this week though. I think we still made it out 
for a few walks that helped her get some
sleep later in the day.

## wrap up
As a new dad, I'm really glad that the 
opportunity to stay home with Gwen for a few
weeks presented itself in the way that it did.
With only being off for 2 weeks after she
was born, I don't think I had the time to fully
shut off from work then. I distinctly remember
telling my father-in-law that I would be fine
going back to work because I had no control
over anything otherwise. Having a negative 
attitude about going back wasn't going to get me
any more time off. And once I was back, there was
a certain simplicity in continuing with the
routine. All of this is to say that I'm not sure
I would have taken as much time if it wasn't 
absolutely necessary.

It's always nice to not have work to worry about.
It was especially nice to get some one-on-one time
with Gwen. Even though the days mostly consisted 
of me trying to keep up with her needs,
it was great for me to get a taste of what Grace
was doing day in and day out for the past few
months. There were times of struggle,
but I think that's a microcosm of life. Keeping 
a calm demeanor, being patient, and trying to 
take care of the most important things first
seemed to help me through these situations.

There were fun times too. We got out for some
nice walks and listened to a ton of Taylor
Swift. I'm admittedly a bit of a Swifty, so I guess
you could say we're starting Gwen young.
Gwen and I also watched mass each day
during these weeks. And it works out pretty well.
Gwen loves watching screens (which might be a
problem in the future). We'd start the daily TV 
mass while she was eating and she could stare at the
mass while she was burping. Maybe coincidentally,
maybe not, I found her staring especially when the
bells ring during the consecration.

In hindsight,
some of the best times during these weeks were 
when I was just present and not worrying about 
anything else. It's really easy for me to get caught up
in the list of checkboxes, but the simplicity of
just being present and not trying to get anything
done was fulfilling. I'll cherish these
weeks for many years to come.
