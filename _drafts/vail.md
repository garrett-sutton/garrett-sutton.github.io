## The TLDR
We went to Vail as part of a big family/friend
trip in March 2023. The day at Vail was day 
2 of 4 for our trip. This day will go down
as one of the my favorite and most memorable 
days of skiing ever. 

### The would I go back?
Without hesitation, yes. From very early in the 
day, I was saying "this place lives up to the hype."
It's also worth noting that I was initially 
hesitant to go to Vail because of the cost, crowds,
and hoity-toity nature. 

I'll commentate through more below, but this notion of 
wanting to go back is heavily influenced by the 
dream of a storm we encountered while skiing Vail.
