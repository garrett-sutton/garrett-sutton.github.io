## The TLDR
We went to Vail as part of a big family/friend
trip in March 2023. The day at Vail was day 
2 of 4 for our trip. This day will go down
as one of the my favorite and most memorable 
days of skiing ever. 

### The would I go back?
Without hesitation, yes. From very early in the 
day, I was saying "this place lives up to the hype."
It's also worth noting that I was initially 
hesitant to go to Vail because of the cost, crowds,
and hoity-toity nature. 

I'll commentate through more below, but this notion of 
wanting to go back is heavily influenced by the 
dream of a storm we encountered while skiing Vail. We also
barely touched most of the mountain in the day we were here.

## The day
__It may be best to read about the day with the [Vail maps]__
__open to to give context on the landmarks and lifts that__
__are referenced.__

We started our day from a parking garage in Vail Village
and quickly made it to the top of the mountain. As soon
as the Legendary Back Bowls were open, we started navigating
through the - Sun Up Bowl, Sun Down Bowl.

In the Sun Down Bowl in particular, runs were quite long,
bumpy and covered in cruddy snow. Some of the snow even had
an inch thick layer of ice on top of it. It was pretty sunny
during this time of the day. 

We stayed in the Back Bowls until eating lunch at Buffalos. 
After lunch, we headed back to the Blue Sky Basin. To get there,
Grace and I took a run through Sun up Bowl, up Sun up Express and
down generally under the Tea Cup Express to arrive at Skyline Express.
Others in our group took a long wavering route over with no lift but 
I believe with some pushing to get to the same spot. I only call this
out because those others called out it was not a fun way. Grace and
I enjoyed just making 2 runs of it. The snow was great along our 
path. 

This is when the real fun started. Seemingly on queue, it started 
nuking. We got a few laps in on Earl's Express Lift and then
a few longer runs on the Skyline Express Lift. Both had a beautiful
mix of open space and glade skiing that was simply immaculate
as this storm dumped it on us. I let out several child-like
yips as we ventured through the trees on each run. And to add to it,
there was literally no one anywhere during this time. This is 
what you dream of.

Of note, we really only skiied to skiers left of the Skyline Express 
Lift in the Blue Sky Basin to avoid the potential of pushing from
the bottom of Pete's Express Lift back to the Skyline Express/TeaCup 
Express lift areas. Given it's so remote, Blue Sky Basin has to close early, so we 
headed back over into the Back Bowls. In Tea Cup Bowl, got knee deep
runs as the storm kept hammering. 

Eventually the Back Bowls closed 
and we did a couple runs on the Northwoods Express lift. This just
so happens to be where all of the people were at. On return to the top,
we took a run to the base of Wildwood Express to position ourselves
at the top of Wildwood. Fro there, we
navigated blowing snow and steep/hard groomers for 2700 vertical feet
all the way back down to Vail Village. 

And the fun didn't stop there. Just before we all got packed up 
for the day, Grace and I announced Baby Sutton was to arrive in
late September 2023!

### The snow
Any of the groomers we hit during our day were well covered
hard packed snow and no ice at all. I think you can
generally count on 0 or a very small amount of ice in the 
West given the amount of snow they get in a year. This is 
probably especially true in areas of high altitude (like Vail)
where it's more likely to stay consistently cold.

During the morning in the Back Bowls, the snow was 
pretty cruddy. The sun seemingly melts some of the top layer
of snow during the day and it freezes over night. In some
areas, we even encountered an inch thick ice crust. In other
areas, the snow varied widely - from frozen bumps to heavier 
snow that hadn't completely frozen over night.

Then the afternoon rolled around. I estimate that it snowed as
as 6 inches and we got dreamy blower pow for a few hours. 
There's not much else to it. It was like being a kid on 
Christmas.
